Sodium-Potassium Pump::The pump embedded into the membrane of a [[Neuron|neuron]], maintains the [[Resting Membrane Potential]]. Constantly pumps more sodium ions $Na^+$ out of the neuron and fewer potassium ions $K^+$ which keeps the inside of the neuron more negative at the resting potential of -70mV.
