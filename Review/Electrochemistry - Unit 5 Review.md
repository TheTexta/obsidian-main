* [[Redox Reactions]]
	* [[Spontaneity of redox reactions]]
	* Redox reactions spontaneity:[[Redox Reactions]]] only occur when the [[element]] undergoing [[reduction]] is higher (has a more positive [[electrode potential]]) then the [[element]] undergoing [[oxidisation]].
	* [[oxidisation]]
	* [[oxidising agent]]
	* [[reduction]]
	* [[reducing agent]]
	* [[electrode potential]]
* [[Galvanic Cells]]
	* [[salt bridge]]
	* [[reduction potentials table]]
	* [[cathode]]
	* [[anode]]
* [[oxidisation number]]
	* Hydrogen is +1 except for metals where it is -1.
	* The higher on the list the higher the attraction for electrons is when looking at the rhs. Ag+ is more attracted to electrons then Sn+
	* Strong reducing agents are lower while stronger oxidisation agents are higher.
	* particles undergoing reduction are always ionic
	* when answering for temporary charge answer in +/- not actual numbers
	* voltmeters measure electric potential difference (in volts)
	* when metals are place din an aqueous solution the surface of th metal will develop a slight negative charge.

* Hydrogen in all compounds except hydrides is +1
* Hydrogen in [[hydrides]] is -1 (first column of table)
* Oxygen is -2 except in peroxides
* Oxygen is -1 in peroxides
* Oxidisation number method
	* write the number of [[electron|electrons]] transferred per *atom* then per *molecule*
	* determine the lcm to balance the *reactants* with the correct coefficients
	* balance atoms 
	* When there is an acid (excess positive ions) you need to balance the O atoms by adding h2o molecules and than balance the H atoms by adding H+ (only to the side requiring)
	* For basic solutions add enough OH- to the side requiring negative charge then add the apropriate water molecules to balance the O and H's
	* Charge must always balance!!!
