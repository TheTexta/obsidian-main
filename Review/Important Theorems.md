[[Extreme value theorem]]
Formal Statement: If a function $f$ is continuous on a closed interval $[a,b]$, then: 
1. There exists a number in $[a,b]$ such that $f(x)\leq f(c)$ for all $x$ in $[a,b]$. 
2. There exists a number in $[a,b]$ such that $f(x)\geq f(d)$ for all $x$ in $[a,b]$.

*This just means that if a function is continuous, it takes on a maximum and minimum value between the values for which is is continuous*

[[Intermediate Value Theorem]]
Formal Statement: If a function is continuous on a closed interval $[a,b]$ and $f(a)\neq f(b)$, then for every
value of $u$ between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, there exist at least one value of $c$ in the open interval $(a,b)$ so that $f(c)=u$.

*Continuous functions take on all values between the points at either end of there continuity.*

[[Mean Value Theorem]]
If a function $f$ is continuous over a close interval $[a,b]$ and differentiable over the open interval $(a,b)$ then there exists a number $c$ in the open interval $(a,b)$ such that $f(c)=\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$.

*If a function is continuous over $[a,b]$ and differentiable over $(a,b)$ there is at least one point when the slope between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ is equal to the tangent of a single point in that range.* 

[[Rolle's Theorem]]
Special version of [[Mean Value Theorem|MVT]], If a function $f$ is continuous over a close interval $[a,b]$ and differentiable over the open interval $(a,b)$ and $f(a)=f(b)$ then there exists a number $c$ in the open interval $(a,b)$ such that $f(c)=0$.

*If a function is continuous over $[a,b]$ and differentiable over $(a,b)$ and the points $a$ and $b$ are the same output there is a point between those points where the slope is $0$.*

###### First and Second Derivative tests
[[first derivative test]]:
* If $f'(p)>0$ then $f(x)$ is an increasing function at point $p$
* If $f'(p)<0$ then $f(x)$ is a decreasing function at point $p$
* If $f'(p)=0$ then $f(x)$ is a critical point at point p

[[Second Derivative Test]]:
* If $f''(p)>0$ then at point $p$, $f(x)$ is [[Concavity|concave up]]
* If $f''(p)<0$ then at point $p$, $f(x)$ is [[Concavity|concave down]]
* If $f''(p)=0$ then at point $p$, $f(x)$ is an [[Inflection Points|inflection point]]
