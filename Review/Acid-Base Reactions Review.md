# Concepts
An [[Acid-Base Reactions Review|acid-base reaction]] occurs when an [[acid]] [[compound]] reacts with a [[base|basic]] compound. The resulting chemical is a [[salt]] + [[water]] product. Acid base reactions can be used in [[titration]] to determine the concentration of an unknown product (the [[titrate]]) through the addition of a known product (the [[titrant]]). 

The [[Bronsted-Lowry]] theory states that [[acid|acids]] are hydrogen donors and [[base|bases]] are hydrogen ion acceptors.

## Ionisation vs Dissociation in water
[[ionisation]] is different from [[dissociation]] but in the context of the course here they are the same. [[ionisation]] is when a molecules [[covalent bonds]] are broken and the [[compound]] splits apart forming charged [[ion|ions]]. [[dissociation]] is when a compounds [[ionic bonds]] are broken and it splits apart into the [[ion|ions]] it already consists of. 

When acids dissolve they donate hydrogen ions and bases dissolve to accept hydroxide. [[Strong acids]] completely ionise in water, [[weak acids|weak]] do not. [[Strong Bases]] almost completely ionise in water, [[weak bases]] do not.

## Acid and Base Strength vs. Concentration
**Concentration** is a ratio of the amount of [[solute]] to the amount of [[solvent]] in a solution while **strength** is the degree of [[ionisation]] / [[dissociation]] of the [[acid]] / [[base]] in aqueous sol. measured with [[K value]]. 

##### Concentration
Measured in mol/L it is the ratio of [[solute]] to [[solvent]] in a solution. Its important to note that [[pH]] is a measure of concentration not strength, pH meaning potential of hydrogen. The equilibrium constant predicts the [[pH]] / [[pOH]] of a reactions products.
#### Strength
Strength is the extent to which [[ionisation]] and [[dissociation]] occur in [[acid]] / [[base]] solutions. It can be measured using the [[K value]]. [[percent ionisation]] is used to measure strength as well. *Why acids are strong or weak is beyond the scope of the course.*

## In Equilibrium or Complete?
Some [[reactions]] are one way and complete others fall into [[Equilibrium Review|equilibrium]]. *[[Strong acids]]/[[Strong Bases|bases]]* always fully ionise and are one way $\ce{->}$ while [[weak acids]]/[[weak bases|bases]] are two way $\ce{<=>}$. 

## Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs
[[Acid-Base Reactions Review]] are competitions for protons $H^+$. [[Conjugate Base]] is the molecule left after a [[hydroxide|H+]] is removed from an [[acid]] and vice versa for [[Conjugate Acids]].

## Weak acids and bases ($K_a$ and $K_b$)
Weak acids and bases are in a state of [[Equilibrium]], not fully [[ionisation|ionised]]/[[dissociation|dissociated]]. Therefor, *all weak acids and bases have a $K_a$ and $K_b$ value indicating the extent to which they are [[ionisation|ionised]] or dissociated, giving an indication of their* **Strength**. Anything with a K value greater then 1 is likely a strong acid / base.

## Percent Ionisation
$K_a$ and $K_b$ give an indication to acid / base strength, but another way to measure the extent of acid/base dissociation is [[percent ionisation]]. 

For weak acid ionisation reactions:
$p = \frac{[H^+]_{eq}}{[HA]_{initial}}\cdot 100\%$
For weak base ionisation reactions:
$p = \frac{[OH^-]_{eq}}{[B]_{initial}}\cdot 100\%$
#### Percent Ionisation and Concentration
$K_a$ provide a better way of comparing the strengths of weak acids. percent ionisation can also be used in this way but only if solutions of equal initial concentration are compared. As the graph below shows, as concentration *increases*, the [[Equilibrium Review|equilibrium]] will shift so [[percent ionisation]] *increases*. $K_a$ on the other hand is constant which is why its preferred by chemists. When water is added to the system it acts as a stress and [[Equilibrium Shifts|shifts equilibrium]] rightward, increasing ionisation. **Dilution decreases pH of acids and decreases pOH of bases**

## Buffers
Titration curves for weak acid strong base titrations have a flattened region due to buffering
![[Buffer Region weak acid strong base.png]]
A buffer solution resists changes in [[pH]] upon the addition of an acid or base. It is an equilibrium mixture of equal concentrations of a weak acid and its perfect conjugate base. Buffers respond to changes in [[pH]] (via [[equilibrium shifts]]) by shifting their equilibrium left / right in response to the pH stress. 
#### Acid Buffer:
$\ce{\text{Weak Acid} <=> \text{conjugate base of the WA} + H^+}$

#### Specific to weak acid strong base reactions
Since a weak acid  has a low concentration of free $H^+$ during a titration, when the base is added it will consume these $H^+$ quickly. But the removal of these free $H^+$ ions by the addition of a base interrupts the acid eq as a stress and shifts eq right causing further ionisation of the weak acid. Because the [[pH]] changes very little we call this ***buffering***.

## Amphiprotic
A substance can only be classified as B-L acid or base for a specific reaction. Water is [[Amphiprotic]], meaning it can act as both a [[proton]] donor and acceptor. All amphiprotic substances are negatively charged.

## [[autoionization]]
The [[autoionization]] of water into its constituent ions has a very low K value, denoted as $K_W$. $K_W = 1 \cdot 10^{-14}$
# Solving Acid-Base Reactions

## Strong bases and Acids needed to know
#### [[Strong Bases]]
$NaOH, LiOH, KOH, Ba(OH)_2, Sr(OH)_2, Ca(OH)_2$
#### [[Strong Acids]]
$H_2SO_4, HCI, HBr, HNO_3, HI, HClO_4$

## Approximations
Due to the small [[magnitude]] of $K_a$ and $K_b$ approximations are used to simplify problem solving. *If $K_a$ < $10^{-3}$ assume x=0*, but only if you don't know any equilibrium concentration ($[H^+]$ or [[pH]])

## Certainty of pH
The [[Significant Figures]] on the *concentration* of [[hydroxide|H+]] is equal to the number of *decimal places* required in the [[pH]]. 

## Using % Ionisation and pH to find $K_a$ and $K_b$.
Use rice tables

## Common weak base reaction you should know
$\ce{NH_3(aq)+H_2O(l)<=>NH_4^+(aq) + OH^-(aq)}$             $K_b=1.8\cdot10^{-5}$  

## Concentration and pH / pOH conversions
$[H^+] = 10^{-pH}$
$[OH^-] = 10^{-pOH}$

$pH = -log[H^+]$
$pOH = -log[OH^-]$

$pH = 14-pOH$
$pOH = 14-pH$

## Finding $K_b$ and $K_a$
$K_a = \frac{[H_3O^+][A^-]}{[HA]}$
$K_b = \frac{[BH^+][OH^-]}{[B]}$

$K_w = K_a \cdot K_b = 1.0\cdot 10^{-14}$

*If K is < 1 it is a weak acid / base*

## Solving titration problems
in an [[Acid-base Titration]] a neutralisation reaction occurs. The reactions equivalence point is the point where the titrant has exactly neutralised the acid or base in the sample. where the number of moles is stoichiometrically equivalent at a ratio of 1:1.
Therefor:
$n_{acid} = n_{base}$ @ equivalence point
which expands to:
$C_aV_a=C_bV_b$

#### Strong acid and strong base titrations
Produce a neutral [[salt]] which *doesn't* affect the [[pH]].
[[Strong Acids|Strong Acid]] + [[Strong Bases|Strong Base]] $\ce{=>}$ Neutral Salt + $H_2O$
e.g. $\ce{HCL + NaOH =>NaCl + H_2O}$
*Equivalence point is when pH = 7 in a strong base strong acid reaction*. 
If there is an excess of product / reactant, find the excess moles and calculate the [[pH]] of that. MAKE SURE TO DEVIDE BY TOTAL LITRES.
#### Weak acid and strong base titrations
Produce basic salt ions.
[[weak acids|Weak Acid]] + [[Strong Bases|Strong Base]] $\ce{=>}$ Basic Salt + $H_2O$

Some salt anions and cations are stronger conjugate acids or bases than water. This means they can either steal $H^+$ from water or donate an $H^+$ to water which will change water's pH. *Salts produced from weak acids mixed with strong bases = basic.*

Example:
$\ce{HF + NaOH => NaF + H_2O}$

$F^-$ is a conjugate base strong enough such that it reacts with water to produce $OH^-$ ions in an equilibrium reaction:
$\ce{F^- + H_2O <=> HF + OH^-}$

The reaction above is known as a [[salt hydrolysis reaction]].

Generally they look like this:
$\ce{A^- + H_2O <=> HA + OH^-}$

These reactions will be basic at equilibrium due to the hydrolysis increasing the [[pOH]].

###### How do you determine how basic the solution is in a WA + SB titration?
Since at eq the WA + SB reaction is basic, the ph depends on the concentration of $OH^-$, which is determined through stoichiometry. Just remember to divide the mols of $OH^-$ by the total volume of the solution. The moles of OH will be equal to the salt moles assuming 1:1:1:1 ratio.

###### Summary Guide - General form of [[weak acids|Weak Acid]] [[Strong Bases|Strong Base]] titrations:
$\ce{HA + SB -> basic salt + water}$

Keep in mind the [[weak acids|weak acid]] [[Equilibrium Review|equilibrium]] is happening at the same time (you don't need to write this):
$HA -> H^+ + A^-$

Basic Salt [[dissociation]]:
$\ce{\text{basic salt} -> \text{cation of salt} + \text{anion of salt}}$
$\ce{MA -> M^+ + A^-}$

Now the basic salt anion will react with water
$\ce{\text{Basic salt anion}(A^-) + H_2O <=> HA + OH^-}$

From here its just plug and play with all the variables.

## Why does the pH at EQ change for titration depending on the type of acids and bases involved?
In a SA + SB reaction, the two react completely to form a neutral salt and water. We know the salt is neutral because SA and SB both fully dissociate and do not react with $H_2O$. The [[pH]] will always be neutral.
e.g. $\ce{HCl + NaCL -> Na^+ Cl^- + H_2O}$

A $SB + WA$ reaction will always produce an anion which reacts with water to produce $OH^-$ because the $A^-$ is a stronger conjugate base than $H_2O$. The [[pH]] in this case is always basic.
e.g. $\ce{KOH + HF ->K^+ + F^- + H_2O}$

**Just remember this rule: Ions from SA + SB are always neutral and ions from WA + WB are always basic / acidic**

## Define equivalence point
The equivalence point is when the mols of the titrant are stoichiometrically equal to the mols of titrate.

## Explain shifts in the acid base equilibria
The [[weak acids|weak acid]] is responding to further stress by righting in rightward eq so $H^+$ is absorbed at about equal rate of consumption. 

## The stronger the acid the weaker its conjugate base???
This is because stronger acids produce weaker conjugate bases which is why weak acids strong conjugate bases react with water in the first place and do that whole eq shit

## Explain the buffer region
The buffer region is because the [[weak acids|weak acid]] dissociates increasingly so as the $OH^-$ is added which acts as a stress to [[Equilibrium Shifts|shift equilibrium]] in the forward direction, replacing the $H^+$ which is reacting with the $OH^-$ producing [[water]]. Which keeps the [[pH]] consistent because the $H^+$ removed is about equal to the $H^+$ produced because of the stress.

## Identify Amphiprotic
Needs a h in the equation
Must have a negative or neutral charge

## Salt Hydrolisis
Where the weak base salt dissociates for its anion to react with water. that reaction is called the hydrolosis.

## Explain why higher Ka needs more base volume to neutralise
Since Ka is higher and concentration and volume are equal for all else, the [H+] has to be greater for that higher Ka acid. Therefor it would require more base neutralise

## Identify Buffer Solutions
They always consist of weak acids and there conjugate bases or vice versa with weak bases.

## Weak acids/bases and concentration
The relative concentration of un-ionised particles is high and the quantity of [[hydronium]] / [[hydroxide]] is small.

## What in the fuck is $K_w$?
it is $K_a \cdot K_b$ for conjugate acid-base partners at $25^oC$.
