### Reasons for Equilibrium Shifts

##### Temperature
increase in temperature favours the endothermic reaction as it consumes more heat.
##### Concentration Change (adding water)
Same as a pressure change but opposite, water gets in the way of collisions and assists break ups.
##### Volume / Pressure Change
increasing volume gives collisions more space, decreasing them. meanwhile the side of the formula with less moles is less affected by the change, therefor shifting equilibrium to the side with less moles.

This one has a weird fucking graph, i guess if two things increase in there concentration u can assume its a pressure change.

##### Addition of product / reactant
adding a product/reactant increases the number of that thing which can react, shifting equilibrium away from the side added, as the side added rate increases while the other side doesn't.
##### Catalyst
adding a catalyst doesn't change equilibrium, rather the speed which it is reached.

### Graphs

##### Rate vs Time of an equilibrium

##### Concentration vs Time of an equilibrium
The concentrations of the systems will eventually become constant.

### Formulas
$$
aA(g) + bB(g) \rightleftharpoons cC(g) + dD(g)
$$
$$
K_c = \frac{[C]^c \cdot [D]^d}{[A]^a \cdot [B]^b}
$$
**only includes gasses in the $K_c$ value**

### Methods
##### [[The 7 steps to equilibrium]]
1. Write the [[Equilibrium Constant|Equilibrium Constant]], $K$, *exclude $(l)$ and $(s)$ substances*. 
2. Calculate initial concentrations of the substances
3. Find $Q$ and compare to $K$. State which direction the reaction will proceed
4. Write the equilibrium concentrations in terms of x by setting up the [[RICE table]]
5. Substitute the value of E in the [[RICE table]] into the $K$ equation. Solve for x
6. Use the x value to find the equilibrium concentrations of the substances
7. Sub the calculated equilibrium concentration into the $Q$ expression and check if it matches the $K$ value.

##### Percent Reaction
1. find the limiting reactant
2. find the yield
3. find the actual yield
4. plug into formula
5. *state the reaction went to $X\%$ of completion before eq was reached*


$K_{eq}$ represents the relative concentration of products compared with reactants.

$K_{eq}$ remains constant regardless of initial concentration

Catalysts increase the rate of forward and backwards reactions

to find the reverse eq of an expression do $K^{-1}$

inert gasses do not shift equilibrium, inert gasses are noble gasses.
