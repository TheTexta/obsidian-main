### [[Geometric Distribution]]
The geometric distribution is a discrete distribution and it models the number of trials needed to achieve the first success in repeated [[Bernoulli trials]] (trials with only two outcomes, typically termed as "success" and "failure").

If p=0.25p = 0.25p=0.25 (probability of making a free throw), the probability of missing the first shot but making the second would be (1−0.25)×0.25=0.75×0.25=0.1875(1-0.25) \times 0.25 = 0.75 \times 0.25 = 0.1875(1−0.25)×0.25=0.75×0.25=0.1875.
### [[Binomial Distribution]]
The binomial distribution is a discrete distribution that describes the number of successes in $n$ repeated trials of a [[Bernoulli trials|Bernoulli]] process (each trial has a success or failure outcome), with the probability of success $p$ being constant in each trial. The key characteristic here is that the trials are [[independent events]].

If you flip a fair coin 10 times, the probability of getting exactly 6 heads is given by the binomial distribution formula: $P(X=6)=(​\binom{10}{6})\cdot(0.5)^6\cdot(0.5)^4 \text{ where } \binom{10}{6}$ is the binomial coefficient for choosing 6 successes out of 10 trials.

### [[Hypergeometric Distribution]]
The hypergeometric distribution models the number of successes in a sample of size $n$ drawn without replacement from a finite population of size $N$ containing exactly $K$ successes. This distribution differs from the [[binomial distribution]] in that the trials are not [[independent events|independent]] (due to the lack of replacement).

Imagine a lot of 100 light bulbs, where 20 are defective. If you randomly choose 10 bulbs, the probability that exactly 5 are defective is modelled by the hypergeometric distribution.

### Random Type of Population Problem
$\frac{\text{marked population}}{\text{percentage of population}}\cdot100\%=\text{total population}$
