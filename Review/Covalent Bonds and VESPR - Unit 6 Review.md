- H is attached to O in oxy-acids
- Always add "odd" electrons to the central atom
- H is stable with 2e-
- Be is stable with 4e-
- B is stable with 6 e-
- Generally anything n3 and greater will expand (commonly P, S, As, Br and Se) which usually bond with highly electronegative atoms (F, Cl, O).
- t-shaped bonds are 90 degrees
- You must check a molecule has polar bonds before you declare its polarity.
- trigonal pyrimidal has bond angles of <109.5
- When talking about the jumber of lone electrons on the central atom they are refering to the total not the excess (when compared to 8)
- look at question 14.
- BP-BP least repulsion LP-LP Most
- intermolecular - across bonds
- intramolecular - within bonds
- bond order = $\frac{\text{number of bonds}}{\text{number of possible configuratinos}}$
- bond order only counts those which are changing.
- pi bonds are formed by side to side overlap of p orbitals
- sigma bonds are formed by end to end overlap of s otbiyals.
- resonance means that a given molecule has multiple configurations available.
- practice question 27. the geometry of the ICL- molecule is best described as *linear* since it is trignola bipyrimdal linear
- An electron by itself does not disrupt the shape.
- h-bonds require N, O or F
- h-bonds are intermolecular not intramolecular.
