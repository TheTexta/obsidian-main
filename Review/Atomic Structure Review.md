[[Orbitals]] are basically all which is learnt in this unit. [[Aufbau Principle]], [[Hund's Rule]] and [[Pauli exclusion principle]] is relevant as well

### Orbitals
Orbitals::3d Regions of space that only hold 2 $e^-$, [[subshells]] are regions that contain [[Orbitals]] with the same energy.

[[Electron|Electrons]] don't really take up any space in the atom. There is only a probability that they will appear at a given location. This idea is insinuated by the theory of [[Orbitals]]. Which describes probable [[Electron]] locations to a cloud like representations with densities indicating the probability an [[electron]] appears there. [[Orbitals]] fill in singles before pairing up with an opposite charge.

Rules Relating to [[Orbitals]]::[[Aufbau Principle]], atoms energy levels fill from lowest to highest. [[Hund's Rule]], every orbital singly occupied before doubly. [[Pauli exclusion principle]], no two electrons in an orbital with the same spin.

- [[Aufbau Principle]]::Energy level in the atom always fill from lowest to highest energy.
- [[Orbitals]] contain a maximum of 2 electrons.
- [[Orbitals]] shapes are predicted by shrodingers equation.
eg:
1s
2s 2p
3s 3p 4s 3d
4p 4d 4f
- [[Hund's Rule]]::Every [[Orbitals|orbital]] singly occupied before double occupied
- [[Pauli exclusion principle]]::No two [[Electron|electrons]] in an [[Orbitals|orbital]] can have the same spin
