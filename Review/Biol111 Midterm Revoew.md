### Overview
- [[Mechanisms of Evolution]]
	- mutation
	- genetic drift
	- [[natural selection]]
		- conditions for natural selection
			- variation in traits
			- traits are heritable
			- differential survival/reproduction
	- sexual selection
	- gene flow
- Phylogenies
	- [[monophyly]]
	- [[paraphyletic]]
	- [[polyphyletic]]
	- common ancestor relatedness idea.
- For each group of organisms
