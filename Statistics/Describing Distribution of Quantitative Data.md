#statistics 
* Shape
	* [[symmetrical]] - left and right hand of the data set is same
	* [[Leftward Skew|Skewed Left]] - Since the left side of the distribution is impacted by a particular amount of highly leftward outliers, a skewed left shape has clumps on the right. 
	* [[rightward skew|Skewed Right]] - Since the right side of the distribution is impacted by a particular amount of highly rightward outliers, a skewed left shape has clumps on the right.
	* [[Unimodal]] - singular peak
	* [[Bimodal]] - multiple peaks
* Centre
	* When [[skew]] use what as a measure for centre::use the [[median]] as a measure for centre. 
	* When [[symmetrical]] use what as a measure for centre::use [[mean]].
	* Which value in a distribution best describes the typical response?
		* [[Mean]]
		* [[Median]]
		* Compare the Q1 to Q3
* Variability
	* When [[skew|skewed]] use what as a measure for variability::use [[Inter Quartile Range|IQR]] for variability
	* when [[symmetrical]] use what as a measure for variability::use standard deviation. 
	* Are the values closely packed together or are they more spread out?
		* [[Range]]
		* [[Inter Quartile Range|IQR]]: Q3 - Q1
		* [[Standard Deviation]]
			* The values typically vary by 14.35 ppb from the mean of 7.31 ppb.
* Unusual Features
	* Values which are [[outliers]]
	* Gaps and clusters in the dataset

Always include the context of the values

Non-resistant::Summary statistics which are non-resistant change or are impacted when [[outliers]] are removed in a data set.
Resistant::Summary statistics which are resistant *do not change* or are *not impacted* when [[outliers]] are removed in a data set.
