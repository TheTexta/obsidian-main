How do you determine an outlier?
There are 2 methods:
- Method 1 - [[Inter Quartile Range|IQR]] Approach:
	- An outlier is a value which is more than 1.5x below the first quartile, or 1.5x above the 3rd. Just take the 1st [[Inter Quartile Range|IQR]] and multiply it by 1.5 and then check if it is greater then the value. If it isn't, then you have an outlier. Just do the same in reverse for the above range. 
- Method 2:
	- Check if there are any values which are 2x greater then the[[ standard deviation]].
