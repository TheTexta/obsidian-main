[[Sampling bias]]
- [[Voluntary Response Bias]] - Bias from the response of the survey being optional, those with stronger opinions more likely to respond
- [[Convenience Sample]] - Sampling those most readily available leads to bias
- [[Under-coverage Bias]] - sampling a subgroup that isn't representative of a larger demographic leads to under coverage bias
- [[Non-Response Bias]] - when the sample who responds differs in opinion to the demographic
- [[Response Bias]] - Questions in the survey which influence the response given - how do you feel about the digusting food in Osler.

[[Sampling Methods]]
- [[Simple Random Sampling]] - Random subset of population through random num gen or any technique relying entirely on chance
- [[Systematic Sampling]] - when population is given numbers and numbers are then chosen at determined intervals - label participants 1-30 and pick every 5th
- [[Stratified Sampling]] - A sample from a population subset that shares a like quality
- [[Cluster Sampling]] - subsets created through shared characteristics where the subsets themselves are then randomly chosen. 
- [[Convenience Sampling]] - sampling individuals most available to the researcher, PRONE TO BIAS.
	*Less Common:*
- [[Voluntary Sampling]] - Sampling individuals who volunteer to be a part of the study, prone to bias
- [[Purposive Sampling]] - used more so in qualitive research, researchers choose participants they feel best represent the population.
- [[Snowball Sampling]] - Participants are asked to recruit more participants. Like a snowball rolling down a hill gains mass, the sampling population increases as the participants recruit more and more.
