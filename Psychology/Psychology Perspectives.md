There are many different perspective in psychology one can adopt to explain, predict and influence human behaviour. 

### Historical Approaches
* [[Structuralism]]
* [[Functionalism]] - How behavoiur and emotion allows humans to adapt to there current environment. Similiar to darwinian evolution but in the context of behaviour. maladaptive and adaptive behaviour allow us to function in a variety of contexts. [[William James]] and [[G. Stanley Hall]]
* [[Gestalt Psychology]] - Against structuralism in that they believe that not only does each individual experience shape us but the experience of experiencing in itself allows us to adapt and develop according to our surroundings. Similar to how an individual pixel on a painting doesn't make sense without the broader context of the whole painting.
