How are signals created and passed through the [[neuron]]. [[neuron|Neurons]] need enough energy to cause an [[action potential]]. 

Cells have skin called [[membrane]]. [[Membrane|Membranes]] have two layers. [[membrane|Membranes]] are semi permeable, some molecules go right through others do not.

If things cant go through the membrane but need to go through, cells embed protein molecules into the membrane called channels. 

If they cant go through thous channels they can go through something called a pump. Pumps are channels which pump against energy. Channels only allow for diffusion to occur pumps allow for increased non diffusive movements to occur. 

Selective Permeability::The membrane of the axon is selectively permeable allowing for some things to go through and others not.

Resting Membrane potential::The difference between the outside and inside of a neurons membrane, it is -70 millivolts (-70mV). More positive ions outside membrane and more negative on the inside.

The difference in charge allows for the channels between neurons to work, which only allow flow in one direction of one type of particle. The pump then resets the two neurons by pumping the positive and negative charges back to where they came from.


The neuron firing occurs in 4 stages.
- Depolarisation - The reduction of differences in charges. When energy flows into the cell, the channels open, allowing for the ions to travel between the membranes, reducing the charge from -70mv to -55mv.
- Repolarization - The reversal of charge in the action potential
- Refractory Period - The next action potential in a neuron cannot be generated until the membrane has returned to normal. The refractory period is to ensure further signals cant be sent
