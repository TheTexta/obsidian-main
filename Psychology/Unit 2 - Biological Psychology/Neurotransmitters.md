Neurotransmitters::Chemicals released by [[neuron|neurons]] which mediate transmissions of nerve signals across the junctions between neurons. When triggered by a nerve impulse, the neurotransmitter is released from the [[terminal]], and binds and reacts with receptor molecules in the postsynaptic membrane.

Chemicals which transfer signals.
- Synthesis
- Storage
- Release
- Binding
- Deactivation

How are they made?
The nerve cell makes the chemicals and stores them in [[synaptic vesicles]], little bubbles in the cells where the [[Neurotransmitters]] are stored.


How are they released?
The [[action potential]], triggers calcium channels to open up and calcium will rush into the cell. Causing the [[synaptic vesicles|vesicles]] to join the [[presynaptic membrane]]. Once fused the [[Neurotransmitters]] will release.

How are they received?
Once they are released, they are received by receptors, which are specially designed / shaped to only take in one type of [[Neurotransmitters|neurotransmitter]]. Once received, a [[action potential]] is triggered.

How are they deactivated and recycled?
Neurotransmitters floating in the space between need to be deactivated. Either they float away or are broken down by enzymes or they are re-uptaken. Re-uptake means that the neurotransmitters are collected by a special cell, and taken back to the terminal.

If a [[Neurotransmitters|neurotransmitter]] is released while a action potential is already happening, the signal is hypo-polarised, which stops the signal. Which is called [[inhibition]]. [[Excitation]] is the opposite, when the transmitters cause a signal to start. 

Types of neurotransmitters
- [[Acetylcholine]] (ACh)
- [[Dopamine]]
- *[[Serotonin]]*
- [[Norepinephrine]]
- [[Epinephrine]]
- GABA ([[gamma-aminobutyric acid]])
- [[Glutamate]]
- [[Endorphins]]

Neurotransmitters have mimics, other chemicals can do exactly what neurotransmitters do. Like drugs.
* [[Agonist]], a drug that increases the length of the neurotransmitter or acts as one.
* [[Antagonist]], a drug that blocks or decreases the function of a neurotransmitter
* [[Re-uptake inhibitor]], makes the re-uptake of serotonin slow/stop.

How agonists and antagonists work
Agonists and antagonists work based on shape, agonists have the same binding shape for a receptor. Antagonists have the same shape but close the receptor.
