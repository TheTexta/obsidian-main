Neuron::A Neuron takes a input or [[Vector|collection]] of inputs and transforms them into a single output or collection of outputs. A [[Nerve cell]] which is the basis of the [[Nervous System]], specialised to transmit information.

[[Neuron Terminals|Terminals]] either connected to more neurons or muscle tissue. Most [[axon|axons]] are wrapped in [[myelin sheath]], helps speed the Neurons. The spaces between the gaps are known as [[Nodes of Ranvier]]. [[Nerve cell]] is a neuron.

Three types of neurons
- [[afferent neurons]]
- [[efferent neurons]]
- [[interneurons]]
