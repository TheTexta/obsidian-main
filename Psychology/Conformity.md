Changing your [[attitude]] or [[behaviour]] to match the people around you. Changing your [[behaviour]] to match the [[Behaviour|behaviours]] of others. Note the *conformity* is a choice while [[Obedience]] is not a choice but a deliberate disobaence when you don't do the thing.

From the [[Asch study of Conformity]] it was found that people are more likely to conform when:
* made to feel incompetent of insecure
* in a group where everyone else agrees
* Admire the groups status and attractiveness
* Haven't made a prior commitment to any response
* know that others in the group will observe our behaviour
* Are from a culture that strongly encourages group think  - [[Cross Cultural bias]]
