While [[Behaviourism]] argues that behaviour was all a result of good and bad inputs, deterministic, humanism argues that while that is true there is still a large element of free will in the actions that one takes. allowing for the individual to achieve personal growth, rather then be locked into a certain bubble just because of external stimuli received.  [[Abraham Maslow]] and [[Carl Rogers]] were key psychologists in the humanism perspective. Believing that our behaviours as choices guided by physiological, emotional, or spiritual needs, opposed to just physical/emotional. However this school of thought was incredibly difficult to scientifically study because of its focus on psychological wants and needs unobservable in real life. Because of this it is not used much in a modern sense.
