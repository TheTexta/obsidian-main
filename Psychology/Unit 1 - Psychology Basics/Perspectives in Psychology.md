There are many different perspective in psychology one can adopt to explain, predict and influence human [[Behaviour]]. 

### Historical Approaches
* [[Structuralism]] - [[Wilhelm Wundt]], [[Edward B. Titchener|Edward Titchener]], The study of the internal unobservable processes in the [[Brain]]. Uses introspection to make predictions about the brains structure.
* [[Functionalism]] - How [[Behaviour]] and [[emotion]] allows humans to adapt to there current environment. Similar to darwinian evolution but in the [[context]] of [[Behaviour]]. maladaptive and adaptive [[Behaviour]] allow us to function in a variety of contexts. [[William James]] and [[Granville Stanley Hall]]
* [[Gestalt Psychology]] - Against [[Structuralism]] in that they believe that not only does each individual experience shape us but the experience of experiencing in itself allows us to adapt and develop according to our surroundings. Similar to how an individual pixel on a painting doesn't make sense without the broader [[context]] of the whole painting. [[Max Wertheimer]]

### Theoretical Approaches - Modern Psychology
* [[Positive Psychology]] - how psychology can be used to achieve growth and self actualisation, [[Martin Seligman]]
* [[Evolutionary Psychology]] - how [[Behaviour]] and development has changed over time due to evolution
* [[Cognitive Psychology]] - How [[Behaviour]] is related to internal biological processes.
	* [[Cognitive Neuroscience]] - How the [[Brain]] functions on a neurological level
* [[Behaviourism]] - How what we observe impacts the way we perceive the world. Conditioning. [[B. F. Skinner|BF Skinner]], [[Ivan Pavlov]], [[John B. Watson|John Watson]]
* [[Humanistic Psychology]] - [[Behaviourism]] but focussed on achieving maximum human potential, [[Carl Rogers|carl rogers]] and [[Abraham Maslow]].
* [[Biological Psychology]] - The study of the intersection between biology and psychology. How [[Behaviour]] is directly linked to biological functions.
* [[Psychoanalysis|Psychoanalytical]] - Very little considered valid today of Freuds theories, some of the therapeutic approaches are still used in therapy. How the unconsious mind influences [[Behaviour]].
* [[Social-Cultural Psychology]] - How society/[[Culture]] influences [[Behaviour]]
