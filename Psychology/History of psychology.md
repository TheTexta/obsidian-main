Since the beginning of mankind it is thought that humans have always pondered the mind and its functions and behaviour. Evident by the process of [[trephination]] existent in the stone-age.

Later on Greek philosophers [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]] deduced that the mind is separable from the body and continues to live after the body itself dies. [[Aristotle]] believed that knowledge wasn't innate, instead growing in the mind from experiences stored in memories. 

In the 1600s, "modern science" emerged and new theories were formed about the mind and its contents. Rene Descartes agreed with Aristotle on the knowledge theory and expanded upon it with his own theory of little spirits which communicated actions from the brains and travelled to the muscles where there interactions would cause movement and contraction, and that memories were formed in the brain when the spirits filled these pores in the brain. This communication is akin the that between neurons in the modern perspective. 
In Britain, John Locke wrote the famous paper "An essay concerning Human Understanding", about the limits of human knowledge, wherein he argues that the mind at birth is a "tabula rasa" - a blank slate so to speak. Francis Bacon and Locke would go on to form the ideas around modern [[imperialism]].

The true origin of psycho is in 1879 when [[Wilhelm Wundt]] setup the first pscyh lab in Germany. One of his students [[Edward B. Titchener]] would go on to start the first school of psychology [[Structuralism]], focusing on sensations and there causes and interlinking properties. Another early psychologist, [[William James]] would then go on to start the second school of psychology, [[Functionalism]]

## Early 20th Cent Approaches
* [[Gestalt Psychology]]
* [[Psychoanalysis]]
* [[Behaviourism]]

Later in the 1960s [[Humanistic Psychology|humanism]] began to be popularised. The history of pre modern psychology ends here, as around the same time humanism was introduced, and quickly debunked, [[Cognitive Psychology]] was introduced as the first modern psychological perspective. Combining the biological science of the brain with the study of the mind.
