# Information Processing Model
Focuses on how information is processed in stages
Assumes the processing of information from memory storage is similar to the way a computer processes memory in a series of three stages.
# Parallel Distributed Processing Model
Memories are stored consciously and unconsciously.
# Levels of Processing Model
Assumes the length of time something will be remembered depends on the stage of memory in which it is stored. Not all memories are equal, unlike how the information processing model assumes it to be.
