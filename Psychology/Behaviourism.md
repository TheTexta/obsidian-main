The psychological perspective that focused on observable behaviour, not unobservable concepts like the [[Psychoanalysis|unconscious mind]]. [[Ivan Pavlov]] popularised this perspective with some of his famous conditioning experiments. Those who worked with behaviourism especially [[John B. Watson]],  believed that all of psychology should be focussed on on observing and understanding the behaviour and causes of behaviour. AKA responses to stimuli. 
Later [[B. F. Skinner]] would go on to expand the field of behaviourism with his introduction of the idea of reinforcement, environmental stimuli encouraging or discouraging certain behaviour. Behaviour psychology was popular from the 1920s until the 1960s.
