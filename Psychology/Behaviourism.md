The psychological perspective that focused on observable behaviour, not unobservable concepts like the [[Psychoanalysis|unconscious mind]]. [[Ivan Pavlov]] popularised this perspective with some of his famous conditioning experiments. Those who worked with behaviourism especially [[John B. Watson]],  believed that all of psychology should be focussed on on observing and understanding the behaviour and causes of behaviour. AKA responses to stimuli. 

Later [[B. F. Skinner]] would go on to expand the field of behaviourism with his introduction of the idea of reinforcement, environmental stimuli encouraging or discouraging certain behaviour. Behaviour psychology was popular from the 1920s until the 1960s.

[[B. F. Skinner]] was also famous for "the rat is always right". Meaning that a test subject will always do what it is designed to do in a lab experiment. He measured the time it took for people to make judgements about what a sound was. Measuring sensation and perception of different inputs. He coined the turn introspection defined at the time as measuring ones internal cognitive ability. 

**TLDR: Behaviourism is the belief that psycholgoy whouls only be studied in relevance to direct observable behaviour. It is the idea that all behaviour has a cause and that psychology should study what causes lead to what behaviours.**
