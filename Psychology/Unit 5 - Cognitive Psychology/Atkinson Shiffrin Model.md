Three components:
- Sensory memory
- [[Short-Term Memory]]
- Long-Term Memory
- [[Working Memory]] - where the short term memory is but sepperate.

Analogy:
Think of a desk, you can brings files from filing cabinet (long term memory) or you can get some new files from someone else (sensory input). You could also get some files from your desk (short term memory)
