The strength of a relationship in [[Correlation Research]], ranging from -1.00 - +1.00. 

A negative correlation $lim_{x \to \infty}f(x) = -\infty$. 

Positive correlation that  $lim_{x \to \infty}f(x) = \infty$. 

The [[Absolute Function]] of the correlational coefficient shoes the strength of the correlation. eg 0.6 is more correlated then -0.4. Without sufficient data, correlations are inaccurate and inconsistent. Over time and data, values will regress towards the mean.
