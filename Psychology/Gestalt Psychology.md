Gestalt psychology is rarely used in a modern context, despite it arguing against [[structuralism]] in that it believed our perception of the world was more then just the accumulation of past perceptual experiences. Instead, psychologists like [[Max Weber]] and [[Max Wertheimer]] argued that someones experience was more then just what they actually experienced and instead influenced by other factors, and the whole experience in itself was an experience, similar to how the individual pixels in a painting don't make anything special until combined.
