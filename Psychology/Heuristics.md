A shortcut. The brain creates shortcuts to be more efficient, these mental shortcuts are known as heuristics. Heuristics can be prone to [[Prejudice|cognitive bias]].

### Availability Heuristic
Your brain comes to believe that something happens more frequently if it is more vivid. memorable. Boring things are harder to remember and therefor believed to occur less frequently. Because interesting things are more easily remembered, we have a heuristic/shortcut that makes us believe the vivid things are happening more often. Availability heuristics are what creates problems of stereotypes such as the problem where people assume that people who wear hijabs are terrorists due to vivid and rememberable conflicts in the middle east.
