[[Stanley Milgram]] recruited participants told they were participating in a experiment to test the effects of punishment on learning behaviour at [[Yale]] university. The participants believed that they had been randomly assigned to either the teacher or learner role. in reality they were all given the teacher role. they were then instructed to push a button which would supposedly deliver a shock the the learner when the learner failed a simple memory test. they were told to shock the people continuously until they got the highest voltage. only 65% of participants went to the highest voltage.

The experiment had a huge number of ethical violations!!!!
