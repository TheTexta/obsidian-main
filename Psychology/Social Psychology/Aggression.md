Aggression is a form of [[social interaction]], wherein the person is harmfully interacting with another. Physical / social harm which is *deliberate*, is known as aggression. Unintended social / physical harm is *not aggression.*
### Instrumental Aggression
Where the aggressive behaviour is intended for a purpose/end.
### Hostile Aggression
Where the aggression has no clear purpose.

## Biological influence on Aggression
### Genetic Influences
[[Twin studies]], show us that those of similar genetic code have similar levels of aggression. The monoamine oxidase MAOA gene known as the "warrior gene" is a genetic marker for aggression.
### Neural influences
[[Amygdala]] is involved in aggression as it produces the fight/flight response to perceived dangerous situations, tldr: when threatened we can get aggressive. The [[prefrontal cortex]] is involved in the impulse control component of the brain. In effect it is a control centre for aggression. when activated we are more capable of controlling our aggressive tendencies.
### Biochemical influences
[[Testosterone]]:
testosterone influences the neural systems which control aggression, wide bodies and faces have more natural testosterone. 
[[Alcohol]]:
Alcohol is a disinhebitor, it lowers chemicals in our body which control mood and motivation, it lowers serotonin which is a mood stabiliser, making people more moody. 
## Psychological an sociocultural influences on aggression
### Aversive Events: The *frustration-aggression* principle
Frustration, the blocking of an attempt to achieve some goal, creates anger, which can generate aggression. In hotter years, more violent crimes are correlated. 
### Social Learning Theory
We model behaviour observed, especially in children, this creates issues where the parents emotional issues are passed onto the kids through social learning. This was proven in the [[Bobo Doll Experiment]] by [[Albert Bandura]].
### Media models for violence and behaviour as a whole
Violent media in all forms increases the likelihood for violent behaviour. That does not mean that all people who consume such content are more likely to become violent. It just increases the likelihood. content consumed creates models for behaviour, which increases the chance that the observed behaviour is replicated. 

### Deindividuation
can increase violent behaviour. in large groups aggressive behaviour is more acceptable and then quickly modelled to the the aggressors anonymity.
