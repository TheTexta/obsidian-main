Aggression is a form of [[social interaction]], wherein the person is harmfully interacting with another. Physical / social harm which is *deliberate*, is known as [[aggression]]. Unintended social / physical harm is *not [[aggression]].*
## Types of aggression
##### [[Instrumental Aggression]]
##### [[Hostile Aggression]]

## Biological influence on Aggression
### Genetic Influences
[[Twin studies]], show us that those of similar genetic code have similar levels of aggression. The monoamine oxidase A gene, [[MAOA]], is known as the "warrior gene" is a genetic marker for [[aggression]].
### Neural influences
[[Amygdala]]s relation to aggression::The [[amygdala]] is involved in aggression producing the fight/flight response to perceived dangerous situations. 

tldr: when threatened we can get aggressive. 

The [[prefrontal cortex|prefrontal cortexs]] relation to aggression::The [[prefrontal cortex]] is involved in the impulse control component of the brain, controlling how we respond to aggressive inclinations.

In effect it is a control centre for aggression. when activated we are more capable of controlling our aggressive tendencies.
### Biochemical influences
[[Testosterone]]s affect on aggression::[[testosterone]] influences the neural systems which control aggression, wide bodies and faces have more natural testosterone. 
[[Alcohol]]s influence on aggression::Alcohol is a disinhebitor, it lowers chemicals in our body which control mood and motivation, it lowers serotonin which is a mood stabiliser, making people more moody. 
[[serotonin|serotonins]] affect on aggression::[[serotonin]] acts as a mood stabiliser, less serotonin leads to increased moodiness.
## Psychological an sociocultural influences on aggression
### Aversive Events: The *frustration-aggression* principle
The frustration aggression principle::Being prevented from completing a task creates [[aggression]]. Frustration, the blocking of an attempt to achieve some goal, creates anger, which can generate aggression. In hotter years, more violent crimes are correlated. 
### [[Social Learning Theory]]
We model [[behaviour]] observed, especially in children, this creates issues where the parents emotional issues are passed onto the kids through social learning. This was proven in the [[Bobo Doll Experiment]] by [[Albert Bandura]].
### Media models for violence and behaviour as a whole
Violent media in all forms increases the likelihood for violent behaviour. That does not mean that all people who consume such content are more likely to become violent. It just increases the likelihood. content consumed creates models for [[behaviour]], which increases the chance that the observed behaviour is replicated. 

### [[Deindividuation]] - allows for increased violent behaviour.
