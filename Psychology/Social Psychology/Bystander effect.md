Two psychologists john darley and bibb latene looked into the horific nyc incident and coined the term the bystander effect. in one of those experiments they staged a fake emergency and measured the number of people and there reactions as the number of people changed, as the group got larger the responses dampened. They concluded that there was a diffusion of responsibility when other people are involved in a group. 

## The Decision Scheme
1. First notice an emergency
2. Then correctly interpret it
3. Then feel responsible to help - This is where the bystander effect kicks in.
4. Only then does one help
