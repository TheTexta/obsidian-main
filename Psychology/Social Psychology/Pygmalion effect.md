#flashcards 
In 1968, psychologists conducted an experiment in which they took a group of random students, put some into a "special program" wherein the teacher of the program were told they were gifted. After 8 months they found the "special group" who were actually average, performed better on iq tests. This is due to the higher performance expected of them and the teachers.
