Prejudice is an unsupported unjustifiable and usually negatively. An example of prejudice is [[ethnocentrism]]. 

### Explicit Prejudice
WE are aware that we are processing this information
### Implicit Bias / Prejudice
An unthinking knee jerk response that operates without conscious awareness. implicit bias is always present

Implicit prejudice research - implicit association test

1. Unconscious group associations - implicit association test

Designed to measure a persons implicit attitudes. the test, taken by a computer measures the degree of association between concepts. People are asked to quickly assign images or words  into particular categories. The computer measures reaction times, and it is the difference in reaction times over a series of comparisons that reveal implicit biases. 

2. Unconscious Patronisation
In one experiment, white university women were given flawed student essays to asses. they were told that they were written either by black or white students. the women gave lower grades and harsher comments to the essays they believed to be written by white students. more positive comments and higher grades were given to those says believed to be written by black students. is this due to women having racial stereotypes and a patronising attitude? in real world situations, this could inhibit minority achievement. this experiment allows for us to identify bias which is only consciously blocked, eg explicit bias suppression with actual bias still existing. 

3. Reflexive body responses
People who consciously express little prejudice may still give off telltale signals in their reflexive body responses. neuroscientists can measure signals of implicit bias in individuals shown images of people form other ethnic groups they an measure this in facial muscle responses and in the activation of emotion-processing part of the brain called the [[amygdala]].

### Targets of prejudice
###### Racial and ethnic prejudice
###### Gender prejudice
###### LGBTQ+ Prejudice

### Types of Prejudice
Hindsight bias and just world phenomena bias both play a role in prejudice justification which is factually unfounded. 
#### Social inequalities and divisions
When some people have money, power, prestige and others do not, people the categorise people based on these inequalities and divisions. 
##### In-group / out-group
Humans divide the world into the "us" and "them". this can be both good and bad. good is that it creates communal solidarity. on the negative side it can lead to [[Discrimination]]. We are born with the tendency to categorise, which leads to the creation of in-group and out-groups at a young age. We are not born to hate but to categorise. This form of bias and prejudice is studied in [[evolutionary psychology]] where it is believed that we distrust the unknown.
###### In-group bias: 
The tendency for humans to be more helpful and positive towards member os their own group over members of an out-group. 
###### Out-group bias: 
The tendency to have a dislike for other people that are outside of ones own identity group or in-group.
#### Negative emotions
Your [[attitude]] is negative, increasing negative emotions.
##### Scapegoat theory:
#### Cognitive Shortcuts
##### Out-group homogeneity bias:
The tendency to see the out-group all similar but recognise the individuality of those in a in group. An overestimation of similarity of the in-group and underestimation of the ability of the out-group. We see others the same and like as more individual. Out-groups are more prone to stereotyping. 
###### Other-Race Effect:
The tendency to see this bias in your own race but not others. e.g. not being able to see the uniqueness of a group, "they all look the same".
###### Own-Age Bias:
This apparently also applies to an own age bias. The tendency to better recognise people in your own age group.

# Roots of Prejudice
#### Realistic Conflict theory
The theory state that in increasing [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]] are closely tied to an increasing degree of conflict between the in-group and the out-group where these two groups are seeking a common resource such as land or jobs. 
###### Brown eye blue eye experiment
The experiment where the teacher separates the children by eye colour. Where rules and regulations were in place for brown eye which were harsher then what was given to the blue eyes.

#### Social Identity Theory
In social identity theory, there are three processes in our brains that lead to the creation of a thought of a another group.

###### Social categorisation
The first process, whereby people assign categories to others to help organise information about those others, individuals place themselves into these categories to help figure out how they should behave.

###### Social identification
The second process whereby people form a social identity by self concept, including a view of themselves as a part of a social group.

###### Social Comparison
People are motivated to obtain a positive social identity through positive intergroup social comparisons.

#### Stereotype Threat
Stereotypes are perceived by others and an individual, stereotype threats are a self confirming concern that one will be evaluated based on a negative stereotype. People fear that stereotypes are applied to themselves and start conforming to the stereotype, this concern is a [[self fulfilling prophecy]]. People who understand stereotypes, are prone to behave in a way which fits it so they can reduce the threat.

#### Experiments
[[Pygmalion effect]] - group indoctrination creates bias to others.
[[Robbers Cave]] - separated groups develop prejudice to one another

# Overcoming prejudice
* Increasing contact between the target of the stereotyping and the holder of the stereotype. 
* Increasing education of stereotypes
* Reducing stereotype threats
