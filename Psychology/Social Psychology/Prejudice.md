Prejudice::an unsupported unjustifiable and usually negative treatment of a person due to [[attitude]]. 

An example of prejudice is [[ethnocentrism]]. 

## Forms of Prejudice
### [[Explicit Bias|Explicit Prejudice]]
### [[Implicit Bias|Implicit Bias / Prejudice]]

## Targets of prejudice
###### Racial and ethnic prejudice
###### Gender prejudice
###### LGBTQ+ Prejudice

### Types of Prejudice
[[Hindsight bias]] and [[Just world phenomenon|just world phenomena]] bias both play a role in prejudice justification which is factually unfounded. 
#### Social inequalities and divisions
When some people have money, power, prestige and others do not, people the categorise people based on these inequalities and divisions. 
##### In-group / out-group
Humans divide the world into the "us" and "them". this can be both good and bad. good is that it creates communal solidarity. on the negative side it can lead to [[Discrimination]]. We are born with the tendency to categorise, which leads to the creation of [[in-group]] and [[out-group|out-groups]] at a young age. We are not born to hate but to categorise. This form of bias and prejudice is studied in [[Evolutionary Psychology]] where it is believed that we distrust the unknown.
###### In-group bias: 
The tendency for humans to be more helpful and positive towards member of their own group over members of an out-group. 
###### Out-group bias: 
The tendency to have a dislike for other people that are outside of ones own identity group or in-group.
#### Negative emotions
Your [[attitude]] is negative, increasing negative emotions.
##### [[Scapegoat Theory]]

#### Cognitive Shortcuts
##### Out-group homogeneity bias:
The tendency to see the [[out-group]] all similar but recognise the individuality of those in a [[in-group]]. An overestimation of similarity of the in-group and underestimation of the ability of the out-group. We see others the same and like as more individual. [[out-group|Out-groups]] are more prone to stereotyping. 
###### Other-Race Effect:
The tendency to see this [[bias]] in your own race but not others. e.g. not being able to see the uniqueness of a group, "they all look the same".
###### Own-Age Bias:
This apparently also applies to an own age bias. The tendency to better recognise people in your own age group.

## Roots of Prejudice
#### Realistic Conflict theory
The theory state that in increasing [[prejudice]] and [[discrimination]] are closely tied to an increasing degree of conflict between the in-group and the out-group where these two groups are seeking a common resource such as land or jobs. As soon as you creates groups you create prejudice. But group creation is inevitable, without complete zombificatoin of everyone into like states.
###### Brown eye blue eye experiment
The experiment where the teacher separates the children by eye colour. Where rules and regulations were in place for brown eye which were harsher then what was given to the blue eyes.

#### Social Identity Theory
In social identity theory, there are three processes in our brains that lead to the creation of a thought of a another group.
###### [[Social Categorisation]]
###### [[Social identification]]
###### [[Social Comparison]]

#### Stereotype Threat
Stereotypes are perceived by others and an individual, stereotype threats are a self confirming concern that one will be evaluated based on a negative stereotype. People fear that stereotypes are applied to themselves and start conforming to the stereotype, this concern is a [[self fulfilling prophecy]]. People who understand stereotypes, are prone to behave in a way which fits it so they can reduce the threat.

#### Experiments
[[Pygmalion effect]] - group indoctrination creates bias to others.
[[Robbers Cave]] - separated groups develop prejudice to one another
