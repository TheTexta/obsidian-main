Based on the theory that people want to have consistent [[behaviour]] that matches there [[Attitude|attitudes]] and beliefs. A lack of consistency causes internal conflict, motivating individuals to return to there base state.

## Leon Festinger's experiment on cognitive dissonance
In 1959 [[Leon Festinger]] conducted an experiment on cognitive dissonance. The experiment placed participants into two groups, both required to do the same boring task of sort spoons into containers for an hour. At the end one group was offered $20, the other $1, to convince the next batch of participants the experiment was enjoyable. When asked to rate there own enjoyment of the exercise, surprisingly those who were paid $1 reported higher happiness. [[Leon Festinger]] hypothesised this was due to the cognitive dissonance affect of mental tension forcing the participants to balance the disruption to there [[attitude]] and [[behaviour]] discontinuity by making them feel happier about the task so that the lie they told the next group was less uncomfortable. The group paid $20 did not feel this same motivation "20 is 20 dollars".
