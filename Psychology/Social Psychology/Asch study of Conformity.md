In 1951, [[Solomon Asch]] produced a study on [[conformity]]. Two cards were shown two cards, one with a line and one with 3 lines of varying shape. 10 people before you say the incorrect value and when it is the subjects turn there is a 75% chance that the person will conform and state the incorrect value despite knowing the right answer. The 10 people who came before were in on the experiment are known as the [[confederate]] group.
