Implicit Bias::An unthinking knee jerk response that operates without conscious awareness. implicit bias is always present, despite any good intentions. also known as implicit [[prejudice]], a form of prejudice is implicit bias, along with its counterpart [[Explicit Bias]].

## Research on implicit bias

1. Unconscious group associations - implicit association test
Designed to measure a persons implicit attitudes. the test, taken by a computer measures the degree of association between concepts. People are asked to quickly assign images or words  into particular categories. The computer measures reaction times, and it is the difference in reaction times over a series of comparisons that reveal implicit biases.

2. Unconscious Patronisation
In one experiment, white university women were given flawed student essays to asses. they were told that they were written either by black or white students. the women gave lower grades and harsher comments to the essays they believed to be written by white students. more positive comments and higher grades were given to those says believed to be written by black students. is this due to women having racial stereotypes and a patronising attitude? in real world situations, this could inhibit minority achievement. this experiment allows for us to identify bias which is only consciously blocked, eg explicit bias suppression with actual bias still existing.

3. Reflexive body responses
People who consciously express little prejudice may still give off telltale signals in their reflexive body responses. neuroscientists can measure signals of implicit bias in individuals shown images of people form other ethnic groups they an measure this in facial muscle responses and in the activation of emotion-processing part of the brain called the [[amygdala]].
