Touch sensations involve more than just active stimulation.:
* A self-administered tickle produces less [[Somatosensory Cortex]] activation than does the same tickle from something or someone else.
* Likewise, a sensual leg caress evokes a different [[Somatosensory Cortex]] response when the person believes it comes form a person they may be attracted to.
