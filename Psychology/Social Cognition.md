### Attribution, Person Perception, and Attitudes
How we process opinions of ourselves and others. 

# Attribution
Perceiving the causes of behaviour.
#### Dispositional vs Situational Attribution
Dispositional says that the way someone behaves is due to there genetics just who they are meant to be. Situational says that the behaviour is due to the environment. Both are prone to forms of bias.

### Attribution Biases
* Fundamental Attribution Error. Mistakenly attributing someones behaviour to underestimate the impact of the situation and overestimate the dispositional behaviour. Blaming who they are over the situation.
	* Actor observer bias - includes attribution error, wherein the person judges the actor but not themselves the same way. Blaming someone on there disposition but not themselves
* Self serving bias: Whatever you do it make yourself look good. You always attribute you success internally, but blame failure externally.
* Just world phenomenon - A world in which everything happens as it should.
* Self effacing bias - Overall contributing success to environment and failure to personal drawbacks
* Halo effect: if someone looks good then you contribute good qualities too them without considering anything further then one factor. basically one good feature brings up the perceived value of all other characteristics.
* Self handicapping bias: By doing something bad you can blame the fact that you did something stupid beforehand, rather then taking the blame. An excuse to not feel bad about yourself or your performance. Like getting high before an exam to blame being high as the reason that you did poorly rather then the fact that you just didn't study AND ARE RETARDED.

# Perception
What you perceive a person to be, without explaining why you have that perception. In [[social psychology]] perception refers to the mental processes by which we form impressions of people. This includes not just the impressions but the conclusions which are drawn from them, based on physical appearance, voice, tonality, body language (all that [[Autism|autistic]] shit). There is a [[Primacy Effect]] in perception formation, which is what gives earlier impressions greater significance in the way we perceive someone then later ones. 

##### Social Categorisation
When we first meet someone, our perception of them allows us to immediately categorise them based on traits we perceive to be similar to other like individuals past experienced. It provides a way for us to structure personalities and infer behaviour and appropriate actions based on what we categorise/perceive a person as. Of course, it is also somewhat bad, but fuck that we all know that personality = perception by general society.

# Attitude
How you feel about your perception of a person. Eg you perceive someone to be stupid therefor you hate them. Attitude is about the predisposed emotion one feels towards an idea. When you meet a retard you feel sorry for them, a predisposed emotion towards an idea. When you see a homeless person feel disgusted at the post industrial complex which produces these issues.

TEH ABC OF ATTITUDE : )
**Affective component**: The feel part of attitude, the way you feel towards something internally "Being happy that sewerslvt is playing"
**Behavioural Component**: The way you visibly react to the situation / idea.  "Playing sewerslvt a lot"
**Cognitive Component**: What a person thinks abut the idea, the way they logically process there attitude "Sewerslvt on top because shes so original"

*Changing Attitude: The art of persuasion*
Attitudes can be changed, what a shocker, because they are learned that is. There are several factors which influence the effectiveness of a potential persuasion.

SOURCE: The tendency to give more weight from opinions of those perceived as experts in the topic
MESSAGE: The message is clear and well organized
TARGET: Younger people are more persuadable
MEDIUM: The form through which a person receives a message is also important
