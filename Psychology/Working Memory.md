Baddeley Hitch - Working memory

Working memory is thought to consist of interrelated systems.
1. Central executive
		Controls and coordinates the other two systems; it acts as the interpreter of the other two systems. 
1. Visual Spatial Sketchpad
		The sketchpad where visual information is processed. When we visualise this is what is used. We trying to get a long term memory visualising is one way to do that
1. Phonological loop
		What plays in your head when you hear what you're reading.
2. Episodic buffer
		Temporary storage that holds and integrates information into a single complex structure or episode. Remembering an event holistically.
