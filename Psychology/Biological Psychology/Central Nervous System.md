# Brain

sensations are different to perception. our brain perceives, it does not sense.
# Spinal Cord
Neurons which sit along the spinal cord.

Three types of neurons

- efferent neurons
- interneurons - connect the afferent and efferent neurons and make up the inside of the spinal cord. interneurons allow for reflexes, responses which bypass the brain. known as the [[reflex arc]].
