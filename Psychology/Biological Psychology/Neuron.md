A Neuron takes a input or [[Vector|collection]] of inputs and transforms them into a single output or collection of outputs

[[Neuron Terminals|Terminals]] either connected to more neurons or muscle tissue. Most [[axon|axons]] are wrapped in [[myelin sheath]], helps speed the Neurons. The spaces between the gaps are known as nodes of Ranvier. [[Nerve cell]] is a neuron.
