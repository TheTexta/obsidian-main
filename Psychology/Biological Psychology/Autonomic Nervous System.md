Autonomic nervous system::Everything which isn't the [[Somatic Nervous System]], all the stuff which isn't sensation / movement. A devision of the [[peripheral nervous system]] which regulates the bodies internal environment, controls glands and involuntary muscle movements. Responsible for involuntary functions, hence *autonomic*.

[[Sympathetic Nervous System]]

- speeds your heart up
- Dilates your pupils so more light can enter your eyes and improve your vision
- slows down your digestive system so blood can be transfered to muscles
- increase the rate of respiration so you can get more oxygen
- andreno gland releases stress hormones
- bladder stops function (in extreme situations)

Parasympathetic Nervous System::Maintains body functions under ordinary conditions, saves energy. The part of the [[autonomic nervous system]] which calms the body, reducing energy consumption
