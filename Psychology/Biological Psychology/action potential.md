Action Potential::An electrical impulse which travels down the axon, the process of the [[neuron]] firing causing the decrease / increase in energy, sending a single down the [[neuron]], along the [[axon]]. Marked by rapid depolarisation of the cells plasma membrane, from a resting potential of -70mV to 40mV, and back again after slight hyperpolarization, to the resting potential. Each action potential takes a few milliseconds.
