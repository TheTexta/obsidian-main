Myelin Sheath::A protective [[membrane]] which surrounds the [[axon]] to decrease the number of steps taken to send a signal down an [[axon]] as it clamps the spaces for the reaction to occur forcing to traverse more doors in the same movement. Decreases the time taken for a [[neuron]] to impulse.  The myelin sheath is interrupted by small gaps, known as [[Nodes of Ranvier]], about every millimetre along the [[axon]]

[[multiple sclerosis]] destroys this sheath, making simple actions more delayed in there processing.
