In 1951, [[Solomon Asch]] produced a study on [[Conformity]]. Two cards were shown two cards, one with a line and one with 3 lines of varying shape. 10 people before you say the incorrect value and when it is the subjects turn there is a 75% chance that the person will conform and state the incorrect value despite knowing the right answer.
