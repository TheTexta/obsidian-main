Two psychologists John darley and Bibb latene looked into the horific nyc incident involving [[Kitty Genovese]] and coined the term the bystander effect. in one of those experiments they staged a fake emergency and measured the number of people and there reactions as the number of people changed, as the group got larger the responses dampened. They concluded that there was a diffusion of responsibility when other people are involved in a group.
