To do something nice completely selflessly. You can argue there is no such thing as being completely altruistic. In [[Psychology Definition]] we don't care if there is anything that is truly altruism, we are just interested in what causes altruism.

[[Evolutionary Psychology|Evolutionary psychologist]] suggest that altruistic behaviour is a way to protect the genetic material for the species. The [[temporoparietal junction]] is larger in those that are more altruistic. Therefor the tendency to be altruistic is genetic. 

The [[Bystander effect]], when alone you're more likely to help someone. 

Altruism::Selfless nice actions on another, evolutionary psychologists believe altruistic behaviour to be a method for protecting genetic material for species, finding the temporoparietal junction to be larger in those altruistic.

# Why do people help those if they aren't altruistic.
### Helping - Self interest
Someone gains something from doing something. This is known as social exchange theory, maximise self benefits while minimising self costs, the theory that [[Behaviour|social behaviour]] is a an exchange process.
### Helping - Socialisation
Someone does something due to socialisation. We help because of [[Social Norms]], specifically the reciprocity norm and the social responsibility norms. 

The reciprocity norm is the expectation that you help someone who has helped themselves. 

The social responsibility norm is the expectation that those in a society are expected to all work together equally for a greater good. This norm is at a tug of war with the [[Bystander effect]], instead being the belief that we should help others regardless of the cost associated with ourselves.
