[[Stanford]] prison experiment is a experiment conducted in 1971 by [[Philip Zimbardo]] wherein participants were told to either act as a prison officer or a prisoner in a closed space. When the prison officers were assigned they would take the role far to seriously, "power tripping", and seeing there own role as defining them, see [[Social Roles]]. The experiment concludes that when people are given positions of power, and told they have that power, they have a tendency to "power trip".
