A method for graphing the frequencies of a variables over a sample. you can use a [[Histogram]] for numerical [[independent variable|independent variables]] and a [[Bar Graph]] for qualitative.

# Skewing
### Negative Skew
The [[Mean]] is lower then the [[Median]]/[[Mode]] due to outliers in the bottom of the dataset.
### Positive Skew
The [[Mean]] is higher then the [[Median]]/[[Mode]] due to outliers in the top of the dataset.
### Normal
The [[Mean]] and the [[Median]] and the [[Mode]] are generally the same.

# Variability
There is always variance between data. This variance can be quantified with measures of [[range]], [[Inter Quartile Range|IQR]] and most importantly [[Standard Deviation]]
