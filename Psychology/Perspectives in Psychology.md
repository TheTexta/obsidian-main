There are many different perspective in psychology one can adopt to explain, predict and influence human behaviour. 

### Historical Approaches
* [[Structuralism]] - [[Wilhelm Wundt]], [[Edward B. Titchener|Edward Titchener]], The study of the internal unobservable processes in the brain. Uses introspection to make predictions about the brains structure.
* [[Functionalism]] - How behaviour and emotion allows humans to adapt to there current environment. Similar to darwinian evolution but in the context of behaviour. maladaptive and adaptive behaviour allow us to function in a variety of contexts. [[William James]] and [[Granville Stanley Hall]]
* [[Gestalt Psychology]] - Against structuralism in that they believe that not only does each individual experience shape us but the experience of experiencing in itself allows us to adapt and develop according to our surroundings. Similar to how an individual pixel on a painting doesn't make sense without the broader context of the whole painting. [[Max Wertheimer]]

### Theoretical Approaches - Modern Psychology
* [[Positive Psychology]] - how psychology can be used to achieve growth and self actualisation, [[Martin Seligman]]
* [[Evolutionary Psychology]] - how behaviour and development has changed over time due to evolution
* [[Cognitive Psychology]] - How behaviour is related to internal biological processes.
	* [[Cognitive Neuroscience]] - How the brain functions on a neurological level
* [[Behaviourism]] - How what we observe impacts the way we perceive the world. Conditioning. [[B. F. Skinner|BF Skinner]], [[Ivan Pavlov]], [[John B. Watson|John Watson]]
* [[Humanistic Psychology]] - Behaviourism but focussed on achieving maximum human potential, [[Carl Rogers|carl rogers]] and [[Abraham Maslow]].
* [[Biological Psychology]] - The study of the intersection between biology and psychology. How behaviour is directly linked to biological functions.
* [[Psychoanalysis|Psychoanalytical]] - Very little considered valid today of Freuds theories, some of the therapeutic approaches are still used in therapy. How the unconsious mind influences behaviour.
* [[Social-Cultural Psychology]] - How society/culture influences behaviour
