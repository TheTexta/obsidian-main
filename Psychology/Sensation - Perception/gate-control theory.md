Gate-Control Theory::Suggests that the spinal cord contains a neurological gate that blocks pain signals or allows them to pass by to our brain. The "gate" is opened by the activity of pain signals travelling up the smaller nerve fibres and is closed by activity in the larger nerve fibres or by information coming from the brain.
