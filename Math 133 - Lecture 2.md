- Solving augmented matrixes through [[Elementary Row Operations]]
- Learning about [[Row Echelon Form]] and [[reduced row echelon form]].
- If a [[matrix]] row has all zero coefficients and a nonzero constant the [[system of linear equations|system]] is inconsistent. 
- A system can be consistent and have infinitely many solutions
- Verifying systems
- Parametric form for solutions. 
- An all zero row (constants and coefficients) implies redundancy / intersection
- If a solution includes a variable equalling another eg. $y=y$ then the solution is best written in parametric form (subbing in $y=t$).
- Solution to the system $x+2-z=1$, $2x+4y-z=8$ and $4x+3y-5z=10$ is $(5-2t,t,2)$ where $t\in \mathbb{R}$ or in [[parametric functions|parametric form]]:
		$x=5-2t$
		$y=t$
		$z=2$
