Cerebral Cortex::The outer coating of the [[Cerebrum]], is known as the cerebral cortex. The outer 2.5mm of the [[Cerebrum]]. All of the neural processing happens in the cortex, not the [[Cerebrum]], which just links nodes in the cerebral cortex. Associated with higher cognitive functions such as language processing, [[How to learn|learning]], [[perception]] and planning.


The ridges formed to increase surface area are known as sulcus and gyri. sulcus are the long strips, gyri are isolated. In front of the central sulcus is the frontal lobe, the back of the central sulcus is the par
# Frontal Lobe
The front half of the frontal lobe is the [[prefrontal cortex]]. Decision making, incident control.
