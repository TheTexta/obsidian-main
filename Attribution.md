Perceiving the causes of behaviour.
#### Dispositional vs Situational Attribution
Dispositional says that the way someone behaves is due to there genetics just who they are meant to be. Situational says that the behaviour is due to the environment. Both are prone to forms of bias.

### Attribution Biases
* Fundamental Attribution Error. Mistakenly attributing someones behaviour to underestimate the impact of the situation and overestimate the dispositional behaviour. Blaming who they are over the situation.
	* Actor observer bias - includes attribution error, wherein the person judges the actor but not themselves the same way. Blaming someone on there disposition but not themselves
* Self serving bias: Whatever you do it make yourself look good. You always attribute you success internally, but blame failure externally.
* Just world phenomenon - A world in which everything happens as it should.
* Self effacing bias - Overall contributing success to environment and failure to personal drawbacks
* Halo effect: if someone looks good then you contribute good qualities too them without considering anything further then one factor. basically one good feature brings up the perceived value of all other characteristics.
* Self handicapping bias: By doing something bad you can blame the fact that you did something stupid beforehand, rather then taking the blame. An excuse to not feel bad about yourself or your performance. Like getting high before an exam to blame being high as the reason that you did poorly rather then the fact that you just didn't study AND ARE RETARDED.
