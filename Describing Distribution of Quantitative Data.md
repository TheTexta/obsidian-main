* Shape
	* Symmetric - left and right hand of the data set is same
	* Skewed Left - Since the left side of the distribution is impacted by a particular amount of highly leftward outliers, a skewed left shape has clumps on the right. 
	* Skewed Right - Since the right side of the distribution is impacted by a particular amount of highly rightward outliers, a skewed left shape has clumps on the right.
	* Unimodal - singular peak
	* Bimodal - multiple peaks
* Centre
	* Which value in a distribution best describes the typical response?
* Variability
	* Are the values closely packed together or are they more spread out?
* Unusual Features
	* Values which are outliers
	* Gaps and clusters in the dataset

Always include the context of the values
