#statistics 
* Shape
	* Symmetric - left and right hand of the data set is same
	* Skewed Left - Since the left side of the distribution is impacted by a particular amount of highly leftward outliers, a skewed left shape has clumps on the right. 
	* Skewed Right - Since the right side of the distribution is impacted by a particular amount of highly rightward outliers, a skewed left shape has clumps on the right.
	* Unimodal - singular peak
	* Bimodal - multiple peaks
* Centre
	* When [[skewed]] use what as a measure for centre::use the [[median]] as a measure for centre. 
	* When [[symmetrical]] use what as a measure for centre::use [[mean]].
	* Which value in a distribution best describes the typical response?
		* Mean
		* Median
		* Compare the Q1 to Q3
* Variability
	* When skewed::use IQR for variability and when symmetrical use standard deviation. 
	* Are the values closely packed together or are they more spread out?
		* Range
		* IQR: Q3 - Q1
		* [[Standard Deviation]]
			* The values typically vary by 14.35 ppb from the mean of 7.31 ppb.
* Unusual Features
	* Values which are outliers
	* Gaps and clusters in the dataset

Always include the context of the values
