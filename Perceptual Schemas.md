Schema is a mental model that provides a frame fro interpreting information entering the mind through the sense or for activating an expectation of how a particular perceptual scene may look. They allow us to organise and allow us to interpret unfamiliar information.  Perception is an attempt to make sense of stimuli by searching for the best most relevant similar interpretation. Schema is a cognitive model to narrow down and figure out what we are seeing.
