#microeconomics 
Taxes imposed directly on a persons income / wealth, or a firms profits. These are direct because they require participation and aren't associated with an actual cost other then the tax itself. As opposed to [[indirect tax]] which is associated with the fees associated with the purchase of [[goods]] / [[services]].
