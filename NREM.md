NREM:Non rapid eye movement sleep, divided into three stages, n1, n2 and n3.

### N1
N1 Sleep Stage::The stage of transition from [[wakefulness]] to sleep, generally only lasts a few minutes. This is the lightest stage of sleep

* Eye movements slow
* heartrate and breathing slow
* muscles begin to relax
* you produce low amplitude mixed frequency waves in the theta range (4hz to 7hz)

Hypnagogic hallucinations::During this brief NREM - 1 sleep, you may experience bizarre hallucinogenic sensations such as jerking or a feeling of falling or floating weightlessly , while transitioning to sleep.
### N2
N2 Sleep Stage::Lasts for 10-25 mins, a brief stage where you can be awakened easily
* heartrate and breathing further slow
* no eye movements
* body temp drops

Sleep Spindles and K-complexes::Two distinct brain wave features that appear in N2 sleep thought to be involved in memory consolidation.

Theta Waves::Present in the N2 and N1 stages of sleep, (light sleep)
### N3
N3 Sleep Stage::The final stage of non-REM sleep is the deep sleep stage lasting for 20 to 40 minutes. also known as slow wave / delta sleep.

* arousal from sleep is difficult
- heartbeat and breathing are at their slowest rate
- no eye movements
- body is fully relaxed
- delta brain waves are present
- tissue repair and growth, and cell regeneration occurs
- immune system strengthens

Delta Waves::Present in those in the N3 stage of sleep (1hz to 3.99hz)
