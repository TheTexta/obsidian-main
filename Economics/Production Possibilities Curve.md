The production possibilities curve/frontier represents all possible distributions of labour to produce 2 separate products. As you increase production in resource A, resource B's productions decreases. Production possibilities curve assumes that there is [[economic efficiency]]

If the curve is curvier then the economy is [[specialisation|specialised]]. Points outside the curve are called unattainable due to [[scarcity]].  If the two lines are linear and parallel, then there is no specialisation and trade which it [[Terms of trade|mutually beneficial]] which will occur under the laws of [[Economic Advantage|comparative advantage]].

## Comparing Economies
When comparing two production possibility curves between two economies, the economy who's line is more horizontal has a higher [[Economic Advantage|comparative advantage]] for that resource, vice versa with the y axis and the more vertical line.
## Rightward Shift
e.g. there is an increase in the productivity of [[labour]].

## Leftward Shift
e.g. There is a natural disaster. Leads to a decrease in possible production from insufficient [[labour]]/resources.
