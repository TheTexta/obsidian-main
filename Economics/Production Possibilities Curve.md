The production possibilities curve/frontier represents all possible distributions of labour to produce 2 separate products. As you increase production in resource A, resource B's productions decreases. Production possibilities curve assumes that there is [[Economic Efficiency]]

If the curve is curvier then the economy is [[specialisation|specialised]]. Points outside the curve are called unattainable due to [[Scarcity]]. 

## Rightward Shift
e.g. there is an increase in the productivity of [[labour]].

## Leftward Shift
e.g. There is a natural disaster. Leads to a decrease in possible production from insufficient [[labour]]/resources.
