Price elasticity of supply is a measure for the way supply changes to changes in price.

$PES = \frac{\Delta \%Q_s}{\Delta \%P}$

When $PES > 1$ then price is [[elasticity|elastic]], when less it is [[inelasticity|inelastic]]

### Determinants of Price Elasticity of Supply
1. Length of time
2. Mobility of factors of production
3. Spare capacity of firms
4. Ability to store stocks
