How does one distribute limited resources to people in a way that will be fair and more importantly effective, resource [[scarcity]].  Economics is the effective distribution of limited resources in a world of infinite [[Needs vs Wants|wants]]. How do we maximise utility while minimising waste. 

There are four main types of economic systems:
* [[Traditional Economy]]
* [[Command Economy]]
* [[Market Economy]]
* [[Mixed Economies]]

Every economics system must answer 3 essential questions:
i. What to produce - How do you product the product through the [[production]] process. 
ii. How to produce - Who in the society will engage with a product and [[Needs vs Wants|wants]] the product
iii. For whom to produce - which member of a society allowed to engage in its consumption
