Income Elasticity of Demand::As income increases, [[demand]] of [[Goods|normal goods]] increases while the [[demand]] of [[Goods|inferior goods]] decreases.
Positive Income elasticity indicates::The good is a normal good, increasing in consumption as income increases
Negative Income Elasticity indicates::The good is an inferior good, decreasing in consumption as income increases, eg. fast food.

Income elasticity as it relates to shift of demand::As income increases, the income elasticity dictates the type of shift that occurs on the [[demand curve]], be it a leftward or rightward shift. 

## Formula
$$
YED = \frac{\% \Delta Q_d \text{ Good X}}{\% \Delta Y \text{ Income}}
$$

positive value indicates normal good. negative value indicates inferior goods. $0 < YED < 1$ indicates that demand diminishes in the quantity it increases by over time. More luxury goods have a higher $YED$ value.
