As income increases, [[demand]] of [[Goods|normal goods]] increases while the [[demand]] of [[Goods|inferior goods]] decreases.

## Formula
$$
YED = \frac{\% \Delta Q_d \text{ Good X}}{\% \Delta Y \text{ Income}}
$$

positive value indicates normal good. negative value indicates inferior goods. 0 < YED < 1 indicates that demand diminishes in the quantity it increases by over time.
