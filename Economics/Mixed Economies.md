Economies driven by the wants of the people but limited by the government in certain sectors to allow for fair and equal play.

## The three basic economical questions
What to produce  - Produce what is in demand, where the demand can be artificially manipulated by the governing authority to incentivise or even mandate the production and sale of goods at set prices through subsidisations.
How to produce  - Through any available means, government grants and subsidations can incentivised certain production styles as they cheapen the cost of production for certain goods.
For whom to produce - Produce for wherever the demand is be it natural or artificial demand created by the government.
