Understanding how consumers make purchasing decisions. Consumers are driven by [[utility maximisation]], maximising there own satisfaction.  Basically marginal analysis is all about the analysis of diminishing returns. As you do one activity more and more over time you become numb and less interested in that activity. This is obvious in the roller coster example, wherein you get increasingly less joy and satisfaction over time as you ride a roller coster, while the costs stay the same, waiting in line, paying, etc. *Remember* "[[marginal]]" just refers to change in the total. Generally we want to maximise [[marginal utility]] at all times. So out of two options, one might be better initially, but after performing it say 8 times the benefit of the other becomes greater and you switch over. By choosing decisions with decreasing marginal utility per price one can achieve [[utility maximisation]]. *Consumers will stop consuming a product when marginal utility = 0.* Marginal utility itself only works assuming the [[Law of demand]].

#### Marginal Utility vs Marginal Product
marginal utility is the amount of happiness gained, marginal product the amount of production you gain.


## Formula
$$
\text{marginal utility}= \frac{\text{what you get out of an oppertunity}}{\text{what you loose by participation}}
$$

marginal utility per price:
$$
\text{Marginal Utility per Price} = \frac{\text{Marginal Utility}}{\text{Cost of Utility}}
$$
