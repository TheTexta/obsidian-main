*Also called the market supply curve*
Quantity supplied - changes in quantity supplied are due to increased price, but only price will cause a movement along the curve
*Supply shifts* - the supply itself is shifting due to factors which aren't price. This affects the entire supply curve as a whole.

When prices increases, quantity supplied increases. Assuming profit maximising relationships. External factors cause *shifts* in the curve, the external factors, known as non price determinants of supply are found through the acronym [[PINTSWCI]]. Outside of [[PINTSWCI]], Future business expectations and prices of related goods can impact the price of goods, [[Economic Goods|complement]] and [[Economic Goods|substitute]] goods both affect the supply curve through shifts. 

The supply curve can be measured for [[elasticity]] through the [[Elasticity of Supply]] formula.
