*Also called the market supply curve*
Quantity supplied - changes in quantity supplied are due to increased price
*Supply shifts* - the supply itself is shifting due to factors which aren't price. This affects the entire supply curve as a whole.
When prices increases, quantity supplied increases. Assuming profit maximising relationships. External factors cause *shifts* in the curve, the external factors, known as non price determinants of supply are found through the acronym [[PINTSWC]].
