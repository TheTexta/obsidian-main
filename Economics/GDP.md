Gross domestic product is a sum of a countries total spending throughout a single year (annum).

## Formula
Sum of the following (government and consumer):
* Spending
* Investments
* Exports
Minus the **import costs**


## Nominal GDP
Reflects the GDP in dollar form without adjustments for inflation. The countries gdp without taking into account the inflation that could have happened in that year which would cause a increase in gdp even without higher productivity.

### Real GDP
Reflects the GDP in dollar form adjusted for the countries inflation by fixing the currency value. When valuations are concurred the price used to sum the GDP is found by using the a fixed value of the goods/services opposed to the value which they were at the date brought. By taking the nominal gdp and adjusting it for inflation you are better able to compare the gdp of a single economy over time to identify growth and reduction in actual productivity.

## Why is this important?
While the nominal gdp is useful, the real gdp is much better for comparing the growth of a single economy on a yaer by year basis. Say apples cost 0.5 in 2022 and the gdp was 1000 but in 2023 the gdp was 1200 but apple were 0.55. The gdp might appear to be 20% higher but in reality everything is just more expensive due to inflation so the real gdp would be lower then 1200. 


### GDP per Capita
GDP divided by the population of the nation.
