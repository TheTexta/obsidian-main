Individual choose where to spend there resources which drives demand and growth/decay in those sectors. In a pure market economy there is no government involvement / intervention and regulation.

## The three basic economical questions
What to produce  - Products are produced according to whatever demand is there for the product by those with available resources to spend on it.

How to produce  - By any means necessary so to speak. Individuals decide how and what are produced but ultimately will be motivated to produce goods which are in demand and that gives them greater purchasing power in there own lives.

For whom to produce - Anyone who has the funds/resources to acquire something. The demand is what motivates the production.
