Equilibrium is the process of [[supply]] and [[demand]] shifting in relation to one another. Equilibrium is the state where [[supply]] and [[demand]] are equal to each other. Equilibrium is also known as the "point where the market clears", so where [[demand]] and [[supply]] are not in excess of each other.

When [[supply]] and [[demand]] shift, isolated or double, a new point of equilibrium is reached. Although [[Disequilibrium]] will be shortly present as the [[Market 1]] adjusts.


Surplus::When there is excess supply to demand
Shortage::When there is excess demand to supply

### Isolated Shifts
An shift in the [[supply]] or [[demand]] by itself can cause one of four resulting diagrams.

### Double Shifts
A shift in both [[supply]] and [[demand]] leads to a double shift.

Double shifts in any direction will lead indeterminants, define::Indeterminants are points where no change is observed in a shift. Unlike mathematics, in economics indeterminant just means no change. Eg. in a double rightward shift, the price is the indeterminant as not change is observed.
