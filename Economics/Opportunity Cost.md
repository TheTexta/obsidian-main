The cost associated with the loss of the result of the next best option when making a decision.
Generally speaking the opportunity cost is the next best options gain described as a loss. So if you spend an hour more studying micro over math and get a +20pts on the test in micro and miss the gain of +8 pts in math then your opportunity cost is -8pts in math.


There are two ways of calculating opportunity cost. **You only use these formulas when there are two pairs/inputs/services. 4 things in total.**
## Input Approach (Resource)
$\text{Opp Cost of Good X} = \frac{\text{Time for good X}}{\text{Time for good Y}}$
## Output Approach
$\text{Opp Cost of Good X} = \frac{\text{Good Y production}}{\text{Good X production}}$
