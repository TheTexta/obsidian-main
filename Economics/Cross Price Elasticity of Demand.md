Cross price elasticity of [[demand]] tell us if two products are [[Goods|complementary]], [[Goods|substitutes]] or unrelated.

## Formula
$$
XED = \frac{\% \Delta Q_d \text{ Good X}}{\% \Delta P \text{ Good Y}}
$$

If XED is positive then the products are [[Goods|complementary]]. If it is negative the two products are [[Goods|substitutes]]. If it is zero then they are unrelated.
