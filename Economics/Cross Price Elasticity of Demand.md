Cross Price Elasticity of [[Demand]]::tell us if two products are [[Goods|complementary]], [[Goods|substitutes]] or unrelated.
Cross price elasticity of demand formula::$XED = \frac{\% \Delta Q_d \text{ Good X}}{\% \Delta P \text{ Good Y}}$. Change in quantity demanded of good x divided by the change in price of good y.
Positive Cross price elasticity of demand::Goods are complementary
Negative Cross price elasticity of demand::Goods are substitutes

## Formula
$$
XED = \frac{\% \Delta Q_d \text{ Good X}}{\% \Delta P \text{ Good Y}}
$$

If XED is positive then the products are [[Goods|complementary]]. If it is negative the two products are [[Goods|substitutes]]. If it is zero then they are unrelated.
