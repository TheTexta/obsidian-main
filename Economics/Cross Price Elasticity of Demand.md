Cross Price Elasticity of [[Demand]]::tell us if two products are [[Economic Goods|complementary]], [[Economic Goods|substitutes]] or unrelated.
Cross price elasticity of demand formula::$XED = \frac{\% \Delta Q_d \text{ [[Goods|good]] X}}{\% \Delta P \text{ [[Goods|good]] Y}}$. Change in quantity demanded of [[Economic Goods|good]] x divided by the change in price of [[Economic Goods|good]] y.

Positive Cross price elasticity of demand::Goods are complementary
<!--SR:!2023-11-25,3,250-->
Negative Cross price elasticity of demand::Goods are substitutes

Cross Price of Elasticity special note::Sign matters in this. Just keep that in mind

## Formula
$$
XED = \frac{\% \Delta Q_d \text{ [[Goods|good]] X}}{\% \Delta P \text{ [[Goods|good]] Y}}
$$

If XED is positive then the products are [[Economic Goods|complementary]]. If it is negative the two products are [[Economic Goods|substitutes]]. If it is zero then they are unrelated.
