TLDR; as price increases if PED is high then [[Consumers|consumers]] react strongly and decrease the quantity which they demand of the item. If PED is low then they don't give a shit. [[PASIFIC]] factors can influence PED along with the broadness of the definition of a market, addictiveness of the [[Economic Goods|good]], the time period considered (longer times means more time for [[consumers]] to react), the portion of income spent on the [[Economic Goods|good]], and the necessities versus luxuries. A *positive PED* indicates a [[Economic Goods|giffen good]].

# Revenue
PED indicates the shift in [[Revenue]] associated with a decision to increase/decrease the price of an item. elastic markets favour lower prices, inelastic favour higher, and unit have constant price and quantity.

# Formula
$$
PED = \frac{\%\Delta Q_d}{\%\Delta P} = \frac{\frac{(Q_2-Q_1)}{Q_1}}{\frac{(P_2-P_1)}{P_1}}
$$
If your a lazy shit use the midpoint formula when you have a calc the elasticity between two points.
$$
Ed = \frac{\Delta{Q_d}}{\Delta{P}}\cdot\frac{P_{avg}}{Q_{avg}}
$$
*notice this formula is change of quantity rather then change of quantity as percentage increase/decrease*

### Elastic Demand (PED > 1)
Elastic Demand::Consumers react strongly to price changes.
<!--SR:!2023-11-25,3,250-->

### Inelastic Demand (0 < PED < 1)
Inelastic Demand::Consumers don't react strongly to price changes.
<!--SR:!2023-11-25,3,250-->

### Unit Elastic (PED = 1)
Unit Elastic Demand::Consumers perfectly responsive to changes in price.

### Perfectly Elastic (PED = $\infty$)
Perfectly Elastic Demand::Consumers will only pay up to a certain price for a good, demand falls to 0 as a result of price change. AKA you buy a lolly regardless of price and you only buy one even if they lolly is cheap as shit.
<!--SR:!2023-11-25,3,250-->

### Perfectly Inelastic (PED = 0)
Perfectly Inelastic Demand::Consumers will pay anything for this [[Economic Goods|good]], your literally the shit. Crack, cocain, lsd, meth, weed and shit are perfectly inelastic.
