A graph of price to number of goods consumed. As the price of a good goes up the quantity consumed will go down, according to the [[Law of demand]]. 

## Tips for doing these in class
* Label the factor that is influencing the shift or movement
* State from x to y (d1 to d2 or a to b)
* state that it is a left or right shift on the demand curve (when shifting)
* State that there is an increase/decrease of demand (when shifting)
* State from (p1 to p2) or (q1 to q2) for movements along the curve

## Shifts on the Curve
The entire demand curve shifts when external factors change which relate to demand. [[PASIFIC]] factors all influence shifts on the curve. Generally factors that aren't relating to the price will cause a shift on the curve, as opposed to a movement.
## Movements along the curve
Movements along the curve happen when the price of a good increases or decreases.
