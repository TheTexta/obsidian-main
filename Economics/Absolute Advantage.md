#microeconomics 

Absolute Advantage::The economy with the highest production of a good with the same resources as another is considered to have the absolute advantage. Economies on this comparison are scaled for assuming access to the same resources, some economies are just more efficient with those resources then others. If both party's have the same absolute advantage then *no one* has the absolute advantage.
