All life on earth evolved form a single ancestral type. Evolution is still occurring all around us. By understanding evolution you can better understand the human body which evolved from other animals without resemblance to humans (fish). [[Phylogeny]]. All animals can be traced back to a single organism. 

Bacteria -> fish -> amphibians -> mammals -> humans. By understanding our ancestors we can understand the different parts of the human body in how they function and were formed through evolutionary necessity. 

Evolutionary biodiversity varies though *time* and *space*.


What generates diversity?
- [[Mutation]] - Most mutations decrease fitness and are considered deleterious. The average mutation reduces fitness by 2%. The beneficial mutations are likely to be of small effect. 
- [[Genetic Drift]]
- [[Natural Selection]]
- [[Sexual Selection]]
- [[Gene Flow]]


Two ways of studying evolutionary change - mendelian and quantitative

Mendelian:

Populations are considered pools of [[Genotype|genotypes]] and [[Allele|alleles]]. Frequency of [[allele]] is determined by counting one type and dividing by total [[Allele|alleles]].

Quantitative:
Most traits are not so discrete so instead they have quantitative ([[polygenetic]]) variation. A reason traits are not one or the other but there is a spread in between is explained through a quantitative approach to understanding genetic variation.
