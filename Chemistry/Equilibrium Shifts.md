Equilibrium shifts are changes in the reaction which will shift the concentrations of the reactants and products.

Water uniquely affects equilibrium in that as a reactant/ product it will shift equilibrium away from the side added, but in the explanation you have to mention how it gets in the way of the other reactions direction. **Units are not included in the $K_c$ value**. Only gasses count in the $K_c$. **ONLY TEMPERATURE CAN CHANGE $K_c$!!!!!!** ***Only gasses are included in the equilibrium shifts. NOT solids*** **BE very fucking careful of the colourless products / reactants**

Water is like pressure, if you add water to a reaction, the side with less moles. So if you have R + R = P, and you add water, the side which is breaking up stuff because the water helps the side breaking up. The left side decreases in rate of reaction since the water gets in the way of the collisions.
### Addition/subtraction of reactant/product
If a sharp increase / decrease of a reactant/product is observed, then a product/reactant has been added which will shift equilibrium.

### Temperature
If there is a gradual increase or decrease of products/reactants, then there is a temperature change which is changing the equilibrium.

### Volume / pressure changes
Increasing the volume / pressure of a equilibrium reaction will shift the equilibrium to the direction with less moles. The system compensates for increased pressure by favouring the side with less moles. Everything spikes in the concentration graph for this kind of reaction. Volume/pressure changes will change the equilibrium, but will affect the concentrations of all reactants and products equally, they will all increase or decrease in concentration regardless of the shift.

System wants to decrease molecules, as a result of increased collisions, with a greater increase on the side with more mols, forward/backward is favoured. Reducing x and increasing y.

### How [[Catalyst|catalysts]] affect equilibrium
They dont change equilibrium, just the rate which it is reached.

### Concentration vs Time of an equilibrium
The concentrations of the systems will eventually become constant.
