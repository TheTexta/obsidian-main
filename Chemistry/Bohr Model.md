The bohr model shows how the electrons configure themselves in the outer shells of an element. It describes how the shift in electron position produces or takes in energy.

When an [[Electron]] goes down a shell it releases energy, but when it goes up a shell it needs energy to do so. This makes sense on a physics perspective because obits require energy to go away from what they are orbiting, and release energy to get closer to the orbit but still be travelling at the same tangential velocity. The number of [[Electron|electrons]] in the outer shell of an atom determine its reactivity, the outer shell in question is known are the [[Valence Shell]].
