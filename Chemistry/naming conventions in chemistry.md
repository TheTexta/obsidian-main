There are a shit-ton of rules for naming compounds in chemistry. [[Covalent compounds]] (molecular compounds) and [[Ionic Compounds]] each have there own naming conventions. Generally, covalent compounds (2+ non metal bonds) share electrons and each element is given a prefix specifying its quantity in the compound. Ionic bonds follow different standards, as it is assumed the ratio of the chemicals results in a stable compound it isn't necessary to declare the quantities of any participating element, it is only necessary to declare the variation of any [[polyatomic ions]] in the bond.
