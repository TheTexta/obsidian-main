## AB + CD $\rightarrow$ AC + BD
Double displacement [[reactions]] occur when two [[aqueous]] solutions are mixed together where an exchange in the [[element|elements]] in the solutions allows for a [[Precipitation]] to form. The occurrence of double displacement [[reactions]] is dictated by the [[solubility guidelines]]. Which allow one to determine if and when a [[Precipitation]] will form.
