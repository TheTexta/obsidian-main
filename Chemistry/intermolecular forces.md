Intermolecular forces are the forces between bonded molecules in a substance/solution. All attractive forces between neutral molecules are known as [[van der Waals forces]]. Which are the three forces, LDS, dipole dipole and hydrogen forces, which each uniquely keep molecules together. 

There are four types/categories intermolecular forces, in order of weakest to strongest they are, london dispersion forces, dipole-dipole forces, hydrogen forces and finally ion-dipole forces. Ion dipole forces are not [[van der Waals forces]] because they require non neutrally charged molecules ([[ion|ions]]).

## London Dispersion Forces
Occur between all molecules, no matter there charge (partial or not). Forms because the components of molecules are in constant motion, therefor indicating how at any one time some positive particles could be aligned on one side with the negatives on the other. Inducing a temporary but weak attractive force. 

## Dipole Dipole Forces
The more [[Electronegativity|electronegative]] element in a covalent bond attracts more electrons, therefore that side of the molecule is more negative then the other side. This creates a partial charge on both sides of the molecule, which attracts other partially charged molecules through dipole-dipole induced forces. Recall that a seperation of charge is called a [[dipole]], hence the name dipole dipole forces.
