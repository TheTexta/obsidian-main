### How are they formed?
As atoms get closer together attraction increases and [[potential energy|PE]] decreases. At the optimal distance [[potential energy|PE]] is at a minimum increasing if they get any closer as repulsion begins.

### HS Def
Chemical bonds which form between atoms as a result of small [[Electronegativity]] differences (>0 and <1.6) and a need to share [[Electron|electrons]] between elements to balance there valency charge (make it = 0). Compounds bonded through covalent bonds are referred to as [[covalent compounds]].
