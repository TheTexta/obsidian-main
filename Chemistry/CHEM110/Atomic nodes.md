There are two node types [[angular atomic nodes|angular]] and [[radial atomic nodes|radial]]

##### Example applying the angular and radial principle
when $n=1$, only possible value of $l$ is $0$. as $l$ is a $+$ integer from 0 to $n-1$. when $l=0$ it is an s [[Orbitals|orbital]], called the $1s$ [[Orbitals|orbital]]. when $l=0$ only possible value of $m$ is $0$ (meaning there is one orientation of the orbital, **symmetric**)

when n=2, 
- two possible values of $l$ ($0$ and $1$). an orbital with $l=0$ s orbital - $2s$. orbital (spherical but with a larger n then 1s therefor larger). 
- when $l=1$ there is a $2p$ orbital (dumbbell shaped), there values of $m (-1,0,+1)$ there are three orientations of the orbital, $2p_x, 2p_z, 2p_y$
### Background

Electron [[probability density]] functions (derived through the [[wave function]]) show that as the [[quantum numbers|quantum number]] $n$ increases, nodes are introduced - areas with zero probability of finding an [[electron]].
