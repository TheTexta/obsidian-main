$s^1p^3$ orbital = s + p + p + p orbitals

An s orbital is a sphere where the sphere tells you the probability of finding an electron. 
A p orbital is a hourglass shape aligned with the x, y or z axis - $p_x$, $p_y$, and $p_z$

### Hybridisation of Carbon
$C=1s^22s^22p^2$ when hybridised $s^1p^3=2s^1+2p^3$
we can see that the 2p has a space for 4 electrons. A hybridised s^1p^3 configuration is used in the triple bond of a carbon $C\equiv C$
