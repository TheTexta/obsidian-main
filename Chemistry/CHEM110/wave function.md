A wave function is a mathematical function that relates the location of an electron at a given point in space to its energy. Contains a radial and angular component that influence the result of the function. Each wave function is also defined by characteristic [[quantum numbers]] $(n,l,m)$. The *square* of the wave function gives the probability of finding an electron at a given point ([[Orbitals]]).
