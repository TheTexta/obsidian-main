Mathematically derived (from the [[wave function]]) regions of space with different probabilities of containing an [[electron]]. 

##### Nodes

Electron [[probability density]] functions (derived through the [[wave function]]) show that as the [[quantum numbers|quantum number]] n increases, nodes are introduced - areas with zero probability of finding an electron. 

A radial nodes = n-1-l, this formula specifies the number of nodes in a particular orbital configuration. 

An angular node=l - therefor 1s orbitals have 0 angular nodes but 2p have 1. 

##### Example
when n=1, only possible value of l is 0. as l is a + integer from - to n-1. when l=0 it is an s orbital, called the 1s orbital. when l=0 only possible value of m is 0 (meaning there is one orientation of the orbital, symmetric)

when n=2, 
- two possible values of l (0 and 1). an orbital with l=0 s orbital - 2s. orbital (spherical but with a larger n then 1s therefor larger). 
- when $l=1$ there is a $2p$ orbital (dumbbell shaped), there values of $m (-1,0,+1)$ there are three orientations of the orbital, $2p_x, 2p_z, 2p_y$

Orbitals - 3d Regions of space that only hold 2 $e^-$, [[subshells]] are regions that contain orbitals with the same energy.

[[Electron|Electrons]] don't really take up any space in the atom. There is only a probability that they will appear at a given location. This idea is insinuated by the theory of orbitals. Which describes probable [[Electron]] locations to a cloud like representations with densities indicating the probability an [[electron]] appears there. Orbitals fill in singles before pairing up with an opposite charge.

Rules Relating to Orbitals::[[Aufbau Principle]], atoms energy levels fill from lowest to highest. [[Hund's Rule]], every orbital singly occupied before doubly. [[Pauli exclusion principle]], no two electrons in an orbital with the same spin.
