Mathematically derived (from the [[wave function]]) regions of space with different probabilities of containing an [[electron]]. 

We use boxes to represent orbitals and [[subshells]] to organise them.


#### [[Atomic nodes]] describe probable electron distributions for orbitals

Orbitals - 3d Regions of space that only hold 2 $e^-$, [[subshells]] are regions that contain orbitals with the same energy.

[[Electron|Electrons]] don't really take up any space in the atom. There is only a probability that they will appear at a given location. This idea is insinuated by the theory of orbitals. Which describes probable [[Electron]] locations to a cloud like representations with densities indicating the probability an [[Electron]] appears there. Orbitals fill in singles before pairing up with an opposite charge.

Rules Relating to Orbitals::[[Aufbau Principle]], atoms energy levels fill from lowest to highest. [[Hund's Rule]], every orbital singly occupied before doubly. [[Pauli's exclusion principle]], no two electrons in an orbital with the same spin.
