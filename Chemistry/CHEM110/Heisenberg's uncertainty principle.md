$\Delta x \Delta p \ge h/4\pi$ 

$\Delta x$ uncertainty in position
$\Delta p$ uncertainty in [[momentum]] (**Remember to include the mass**)
$h$ is [[planck's constant]]

Precision of position and [[momentum]] have an inverse relationship - if the position of a particle can be determined more precisely then the [[momentum]] (but more precisely the [[velocity]] since [[mass]] is constant) of the particle is predicted less precisely. you cannot determine both the position and [[momentum]] of a particle precisely.
