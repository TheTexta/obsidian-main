The energy to break down a solid lattice (formed [[Ionic Bonds|ionic bond]]) into gaseous ions. e.g. $LiF(s)->Li^+(g) + F^-(g)$, $\Delta H=1000J$. Lattice energy depends upon the electrostatic interactions between the cation and the anion
$$E \propto \frac{q_1 q_2}{r^2}$$
$q_1$ and $q_2$ are the anionic and cationic charge
$r$ is the distance between them
### The factors that determine lattice energy:
1. Charge of the ions - (higher charge higher breakage energy)
2. Size - larger size lesser energy (closer bonds harder to break)
