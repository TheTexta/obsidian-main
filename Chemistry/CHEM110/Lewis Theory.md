### Overview
- [[Ionic Bonds]] are formed by transferring of [[electron|electrons]]
- [[Covalent bonds]] are formed by sharing electrons
- [[Electron|electrons]] are shared/transferred so that each atom attain noble gas like configuration
- [[lewis symbols]]
- [[Octet Rule]]

generally atoms lose electrons and form cations in groups 1-3, share electrons to form covalent bonds in groups 3-7 and gain electrons to form anions in 6-7.
