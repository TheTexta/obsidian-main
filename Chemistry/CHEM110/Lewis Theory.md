### Overview
- [[Ionic Bonds]] are formed by transferring of [[electron|electrons]]
- [[Covalent bonds]] are formed by sharing electrons
- [[Electron|electrons]] are shared/transferred so that each atom attain noble gas like configuration
- [[lewis symbols]]
- [[Octet Rule]]
- [[valence electrons]] - important in chemical bonding
- [[noble gases]]
- [[ionic solids]]
- different metals can interact to form [[metallic bonds]]

generally atoms lose [[Electron|electrons]] and form [[cation|cations]] in **groups 1-3**, share [[Electron|electrons]] to form [[covalent bonds]] in **groups 3-7** and gain electrons to form [[anion|anions]] in 6-7.
