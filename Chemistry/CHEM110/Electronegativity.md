#chem110 
The ability of an atom in a bond to attract electron density toward itself. [[polar covalent bonds]] between atoms with a $\Delta \chi = 0.5-1.9$ which create partial negative and positive poles. $\Delta \chi \geq 1.7$ generally are all [[ionic bonds]] with a few exceptions (HF for instance is covalent)

### Highschool stuff
Electronegativity is a measure of how much an [[element]] attracts another. They are key in understanding the [[intermolecular forces]] and [[intramolecular forces]]. The difference of electronegativity between two elements ($\Delta EN$) determines the type of bond ([[Ionic Bonds|ionic]] or [[Covalent bonds|covalent]]) the compound experiences as well as the relevant dipole forces.
