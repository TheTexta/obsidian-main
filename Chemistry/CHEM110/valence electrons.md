electrons involved in chemical reactions and forming compounds.

for main group elements - outer electron are **valence electrons**

for [[transition metals|transition group]] elements: $ns + (n-1)d$ **valence electrons** - the highest n electrons are the outermost and are removed first.

### Example of finding the number of valence electrons in an element

$Cr$: $[Ar]4s^13d^5 = 4s+(4-1)d = 1 + 5 = 6$ [[valence electrons]]
