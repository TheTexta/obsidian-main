- [[Stern-Gerlach Experiment]] - lead to the discovery of a new quantum number. Spin
- [[Pauli's exclusion principle]] - limits two [[Electron|electrons]] to an [[Orbitals|orbital]].
- representing electronic configurations for atoms with boxes and notation (e.g. ${He} = 1s^2$ and up and down arrow)
- electronegativity
- electron shielding
	- inner electrons can shield the nuclear charge so that the electron of interest has a reduced attraction (known as effective nuclear charge) towards the nucleus
	- $Z_\text{eff}=Z-S$ where $S=\text{number of shielding electrons}$
	- in the context of He and He+ this means the ions electron is harder to remove since the He's electrons are slightly shielding each other
	- 1s electrons shiled 2p electrons but not fully as there is a small area of electron density
	- 2s subshell more stable than 2p because it penetrates closer to the nucleus
- binding energy
	- the energy which the nucleus attracts the electrons to
- atomic orbitals
	- order of atomic [[orbitals]]
		- 1s<2s<2p<3s<4s<3d<4p<5s<4d<5p<6s<4f
- [[Aufbau Principle]]
- [[Hund's Rule]]
- half and fully filled orbitals are more stable
	- Exception Cr and Cu the 3d and 4s orbitals can be half or fully filled
	- Copper - $[Ar]4s^13d^{10}$
	- Cr - $[Ar]4s^13d^5$
- [[Electron|electrons]]
	- types of electrons
	- reactivity
- alkali metals
- alkaline earth metals
- halogens
- noble gasses
- [[transition metals]]
- Ionisation energy
	- the energy required for the complete removal of 1mol of electrons from 1 mol of gaseous atoms or ions
	- always positive
	- atom(g)->ion^+(g)+e^-
	- B and Al have the first np electrons which are removed more easily because the results ions have a filled ns subshell.
