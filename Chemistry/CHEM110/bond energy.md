The energy required to overcome the attraction between nuclei and shared electrons. standard enthalpy change for breaking the bond oin 1 mol gaseous molecules. 

### trends
higher [[bond order]] = higher bond energy = lower [[bond length]]
bond length is lower for smaller radii atoms therefor higher group atoms have greater bond energy than lower.
