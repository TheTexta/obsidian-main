Atoms lose/gain/share [[Electron|electrons]] in order to achieve a full [[valence shell]]. except for helium like configurations (they want 2). generally atoms lose electrons and form [[cation|cations]] in groups 1-3, share electrons to form [[Covalent bonds]] in groups 3-7 and gain [[Electron|electrons]] to form [[anion|anions]] in 6-7. metals can interact with other metals to form [[metallic bonds|metallic bonds]].

### Exceptions
Anything below and including period 3 can have more than 4 valence orbitals. e.g. sulfur has 6 ve therefor can form 6 valence orbitals

Boron can have less then 8 [[Electron|electrons]].

Radicals - contains an unpaired [[electron]] and can hold less than 8 electrons. $CH_3$ - 7 electrons. and $NO$
