Experiments show that matter has wave-like nature. [[Electron|Electrons]] ave wave-like properties found through experiments which observed diffraction with electrons. 
##### wavelength of [[matter]]

- louise de Broglie hypothesized that all matter can have wave-like properties
- For light
	- $E=hc/\lambda$
	- $p=E/c$ - momentum of a photon
- For matter
	- $\lambda=h/E$
		$=h/p$
	- $E=cp$
- Because matter has [[wavelength]] [[Electron|electrons]] can be used to shine tiny wavelengths at things (cells) to observe them (electron microscopy).
