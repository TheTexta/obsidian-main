bonds where electrons are transferred over from a [[cation]] to an [[anion]]. usually forms between [[metals|metal]] an [[non-metals|non-metal]] interactions - e.g. group 1-3 and group 6-7. each [[ion]] formed in a [[Ionic Bonds|ionic bond]] must achieve a [[noble gas|noble gas]] configuration.

### Formation Steps
$$Li(s)+1/2 F_2 (g)->LiF(s)$$
i. Formation of gaseous metal atoms
$$Li(s) ->Li(g)$$
ii. formation of gaseous metal cations
$$Li(g)->Li^+(g)$$
iii. Formation of gaseous non-metal atoms
$$F_2(g)->F(g)$$
iv. Formation of gaseous non metal anions
$$F(g)->F^-(g)$$
v. Formation of ionic solid / lattice (releases a lot of energy) compensating for i-iv. 
$$Li^+(g)+F^-(g)->LiF(s)$$
[[Lattice energy]] is the opposite of the formation energy. The energy it takes to destruct the lattice.

### Example

### Properties of ionic solids
- hard, rigid and brittle
- high melting point
- conduct electricity in liquid or molten state
### HS stuff
Bonds which form because of differences in charges of atoms. Unlike [[Covalent bonds]] they do not share charges but instead exchange charges to create an overall neutral element. Ionic bonds occur when the difference in [[Electronegativity]] between the combining elements is greater then 1.7.
