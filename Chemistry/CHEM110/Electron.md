An electron is a [[fundamental particle]] with a overall negative charge. It is the lightest particle in the atom, and the smallest. Electrons have the same charge as a [[Proton|proton]] but in a negative form. Electrons can take up space in any point in a atoms shell. They don't really have to be at any one place in a given point of time. There is only a probability that they will appear in a given space at that time. If you give electrons more energy they can have a higher orbital radius. But again that radius is just an average radius the electron could still be anywhere around the atom. 

### Types of electrons
[[Core electrons]]: electrons that the atom has in common with previous noble gas and any completed transition series.

[[Outer electrons]]: electrons of [[orbitals]] in [[subshells]] with the highest [[Principle quantum number|n value]]

[[valence electrons]]: electrons involved in chemical reactions and forming compounds.

for main group elements - outer electron are valence electrons

for transition group elements: ns electrons and (n-1)+d valence electrons
	Cr(Z=24): [Ar]4s^13d^5 = 6 valence electrons
