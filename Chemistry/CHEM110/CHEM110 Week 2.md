##### Bohr's model and the atomic spectra of singular electron species
How to describe the atomic spectra of elements. So far we know: each photon is absorbed by an electron.

Scientifically the atomic spectra couldn't be explained, although there were mathematical equations which described the distribution. Physically want everything meant was unknown. To explain this Bohr put forward his [[Bohr Model|atomic model]] - lots of content in here.

Explaining Hydrogen Spectra
The difference between the first and second orbit ($n=1$ and $n=2$) is always the greatest. Everything in $n=1$ is the ultraviolet region. everything from $n=2-3$ is in the visible region and $3+$ is infrared. Remember when the electron goes from a high energy to a low energy it emits a photon, but when going from low to high it absorbs the photon as energy.  [[Bohr Model|Bohr's model]] only explains 1-[[Electron]] species - cannot be used for multi [[Electron]] species.

##### Wave and particle nature of matter and light
Light:
- light has wave-like properties - [[diffraction]]
- light has particle like properties - [[Photoelectric Effect]] (used for automatic doors)
Matter
- matter has particle like properties
- matter has wave-like properties

Wavelength of matter
for light
$E=hc/\lambda$
$p=E/c$ - momentum of a photon

momentum is mass x velocity

wavelength of [[matter]]
- louise [[de broglie equation|de Broglie]] hypothesized that all matter can have wave-like properties
- For light
	- $E=hc/\lambda$
	- $p=E/c$ - momentum of a photon
- For matter
	- $\lambda=h/E$
		$=h/p$
	- $E=cp$

If electrons have wavelike motion in orbits of fixed radii, they would only have certain allowable wavelengths an energies. akin to how a guitar string attached to to fixed points can only have certain allowed vibrations.
