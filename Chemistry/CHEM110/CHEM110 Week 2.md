How to describe the atomic spectra of elements. So far we know: each photon is absorbed by an electron.

Scientifically the atomic spectra couldn't be explained, although there were mathematical equations which described the distribution. Physically want everything meant was unknown. To explain this Bohr put forward his [[Bohr Model|atomic model]] - lots of content in here.

Explaining Hydrogen Spectra
The difference between the first and second orbit ($n=1$ and $n=2$) is always the greatest. Everything in $n=1$ is the ultraviolet region. everything from $n=2-3$ is in the visible region and $3+$ is infrared. Remember when the electron goes from a high energy to a low energy it emits a photon, but when going from low to high it absorbs the photon as energy.  [[Bohr Model|Bohr's model]] only explains 1-[[electron]] species - cannot be used for multi [[electron]] species.
