A movement in the medium caused by electric and magnetic phenomena

A whole spectrum ranging from a wavelength of $10^3$ [[wavelength]] but a low frequency or a low [[wavelength]] ($10^-12$) but high frequency. electromagnetic radiation is a [[wave]]. since the speed of a wave is constant the relationship between frequency and wavelength is established by the constant [[c]], which is the speed of light in a vacuum.

The [[amplitude]] of a wave describes the brightness, the frequency describes the wavelength and vise versa which in turn give the properties of colour / form of radiation
