### Applying Bohr's Model
Using [[Rydberg's equation]] and relating the [[wavelength]] of the spectral lines to the energy (using $E=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$), Bohr calculated the energy corresponding to an orbit.

$E=-2.18\cdot10^{-18}\cdot\frac{Z^2}{n^2}$

$Z$ is the [[atomic number]]
$n$ is the orbit (1,2,3,4)

Because we have $\Delta E$ we can calculate the [[wavelength]] using $E_\text{photon}=hv=h\frac{c}{\lambda}=\Delta E=E_f-E_i$ which relates the energy to the [[wavelength]] of the [[photon]] emitted.

To find the energy between two levels
$\Delta E=E_\text{final}-E_\text{initial}$ 

- The energy of each orbit is quantized (depends on n)
- The energy difference between two orbits for an atom is always a discrete value and results in a discrete spectral lines.
- Because of these equations, mathematically the gap between $n=1$ and $n=2$ is larger than any other possible gap (4-5, 2-3, etc). 
- n=\infty if there are zero electrons present.
### Explanation of Bohr's model
- Stationary states - H atom has only certain allowed energy levels where the [[Electron|electrons]] can reside. Higher energy levels are associated with a further orbit from the nucleus.
- [[Electron|Electrons]] can move within the orbit without changing the atoms energy
- The atom changes to another stationary state (the electron moves to another orbit) only by absorbing or emitting a photon. 
- The different states the [[electron]] can reside in within the atom are quantas
- energy (wavelength/frequency) of photon (light) corresponds to the energy difference between the two stated. so a electronic transition of the electron to a higher state occurs with a corresponding energy photon being absorbed. a [[photon]] must have energy equivalent to the difference between those two states. electrons release energy lowering there state in the form of a photon.
- $E_\text{photon}=hv=h\frac{c}{\lambda}=\Delta E=E_f-E_i$
- electronic transition - electron going from one stationary state to another
- The quantum number (matter) here is different to the quantisation number (light)![[Screenshot 2024-09-12 at 7.03.49 PM.png]]
- n can only have integer values and is greater / equal to one.


### High school Definition
The bohr model shows how the electrons configure themselves in the outer shells of an element. It describes how the shift in electron position produces or takes in energy.

When an [[Electron]] goes down a shell it releases energy, but when it goes up a shell it needs energy to do so. This makes sense on a physics perspective because obits require energy to go away from what they are orbiting, and release energy to get closer to the orbit but still be travelling at the same tangential velocity. The number of [[Electron|electrons]] in the outer shell of an atom determine its reactivity, the outer shell in question is known are the [[Valence Shell]].
