### Atomic Size
- For main group elements
	- as [[Principle quantum number|n]] increases [[atomic size]] increases
	- as $z_\text{eff}$ [[effective nuclear charge|effective nuclear charge]] increases outer electrons are pulled closer to the nucleus - [[atomic size]] decreases
	- larger n = more electrons and there is more shielding by inner electrons (particularly in the s subshell which penetrates closest to the nucleus) so a lesser z_eff. 
	- down a column atomic size increases
	- across a period it decreases because your not adding shells just electrons but the + nucleus charge is increasing
- for [[transition metals]]
	- across the series the  size remains relatively constant after the first 2-3 elements. The increase in Z and the e-e repulsion (10 electrons being added to the same subshell starts to add up).
	- downwards the size increases from p4 to p5 but theres almost no change from p5 to p6

### [[Ionisation Energy]]
- across the period $IE_1$ increases and decreases down a group
- There are many exceptions
	- $B$ and $Al$ have the first [[Principle quantum number|n]][[subshells|p]] [[Electron|electrons]] which are removed more easily because the resulting [[ions]] have a filled $ns$ subshell.
	- $O$ and $S$ both have a fourth $np$ electron, the first to pair up with another np electron and electron-electron repulsions are less favourable.

### [[Electron Affinity]]
- increases across a period in magnitude but with an irregular trend
- magnitude decreases down a group only for group 1 elements
- many exceptions to this "trend."


### [[anion|Anions]]
- have high IE and highly negative EAs so they easily gain electrons usually
- Groups 17 and 16

### [[cation|Cations]]
- Cations have a slightly negative [[Electron Affinity|EA]] and easily lose [[Electron|electrons]] tend to form positive [[ion|ions]]
- Groups 1 and 2

### Non Ions
group 18 very high IE and slightly positive EA. 

### [[Electronegativity]]
The ability of an atom in a bond to attract electron density towards itself
- increases across a period
- decreases down a group

### [[metals|Metallic]] behaviour
- increases down the group
- decreases across the period
