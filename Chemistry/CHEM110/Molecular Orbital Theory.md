- If the two $1s$ orbitals are out of phase a $s-s$ $\sigma^*$ anti-bond is created as the destructive interference. These anti-bonds have increased potential energy than the individual orbitals - they are unstable.
- [[bond order]]
- Molecular orbitals are formed by a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO)
	- This combination may be in phase (bonding orbital) or out of phase (anti-bonding orbital)
	- Orbitals are bonding when there is constructive interference
	- Bonded orbitals have lower potential energy then un-bonded and anti-bonded state
