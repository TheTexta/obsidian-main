$h=6.6206876\cdot 10^{-34}$ J/s

Planck derived a expression to describe the phenomenon of blackbody radiation b theorising that energy only assumed certain values (quantised). relating [[energy]] to [[frequency]]. every wavelength is associated with a quanta and frequency.

$E=nhv$

where 
- $E$ is the [[energy]] of radiation
- $n$ is the quantisation factor ($n=1,2,...$)
- $h$ is [[planck's constant]] ($6.6206876\cdot 10^{-34}$ J/s)
- $v$ is [[frequency]]
