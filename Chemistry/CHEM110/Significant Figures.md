### Multiplication and Division
When multiplying/dividing your answer has as many sig figs as the lowest number of sig figs in the input.

### Addition and Subtraction
When adding and subtracting the answer can only be as precise as the least precise number you are adding. The number of *decimal points* is always whatever the lowest value is, regardless of the significant figures in the result. 

**Examples:**
- 350+8=360 (since 350 has no decimal places, the answer is rounded to no decimal places - unlike 350. which would result in 258).
- 550.0+450.0=1000.0 (since both inputs go to the tenths place, the answer retains one decimal place).
