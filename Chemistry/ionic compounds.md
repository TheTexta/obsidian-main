Compounds which are [[Ionic Bonds|ionically bonded]] are ionic compounds.  Ionic compounds are composed of [[ion|ions]], whose difference in charges cancel each other out. 
## Naming
Ionic compounds use so many rules when naming them I don't know who the fuck thought this shit was a good idea. fuck chemistry shit is for retards.

### Roman Numerals
Elements which can form multiple ionic forms typically use roman numerals to denote the number of valence electrons a element has.
#### Example:
$Fe^{2+} \text{ is Iron(II) while } Fe^{3+}\text{ is Iron(III)}$ 

### -ous vs -ic
Although roman numerals are commonly present its also common to see elements ending in ous and ic suffixes to denote the number of valence electrons. This is only used when describing elements with there latin name. 
#### Example:
$Fe^{2+} \text{ is Ferrous while }Fe^{3+}\text{ is Ferric}$

### -Ide
The -ide suffix is added to the ending of the [[monatomic]] element in a compound
#### Example:
$\text{Hydride is } H^-$
$Cu^3P \text{ is copper phosphide}$

### -ite vs -ate
When it is possible for an element to form in one of two forms of an [[oxyanion]]. The [[oxyanion]] with less oxygen then the other possible [[oxyanion]] that could form is called the -ite version of it. The [[oxyanion]] with more oxygen is the -ate version of it. 
#### Example:
$NO^{2-} \text{ is Nitrite, while } NO^{3-} \text{ is nitrate}$

### Hypo- vs Per-
Hypo and per are both prefixes used to denote the number of oxygen atoms present is an [[oxyanion]] when there are 4 possible states of which the [[oxyanion]] could be in.
* 1 Oxygen: Just the Hypo- is used.
* 2 Oxygen: Just the -ite is used
* 3 Oxygen: Just the -ate is used
* 4 Oxygen: Just the Per- is used
#### Example:
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{ClO}^- & \text{ Hypochlorite} \\
\text{ClO}_2^- & \text{ Chlorite} \\
\text{ClO}_3^- & \text{ Chlorate} \\
\text{ClO}_4^- & \text{ Perchlorate} \\
\end{align*}
$$

### Bi- vs Di- hydrogen
Compounds containing hydrogen often have bi or di attached to them to indicate the presence of hydrogen. adding di is more correct with current naming conventions but you still see a lot of bi used. Adding the di/bi to any element just means adding an additional hydrogen to that compound. eg dihydrogen indicates 2 hydrogen. 
#### Example:
$$
\begin{align*}
\text{HCO}_3^- & \text{ Hydrogen carbonate or bicarbonate} \\
\text{HSO}_4^- & \text{ Hydrogen sulfate or bisulfate} \\
\text{H}_2\text{PO}_4^- & \text{ Dihydrogen phosphate} \\
\end{align*}
$$
