An electron is a [[fundamental particle]] with a overall negative charge. It is the lightest particle in the atom, and the smallest. Electrons have the same charge as a [[Proton|proton]] but in a negative form. Electrons can take up space in any point in a atoms shell. They don't really have to be at any one place in a given point of time. There is only a probability that they will appear in a given space at that time. If you give electrons more energy they can have a higher orbital radius. But again that radius is just an average radius the electron could still be anywhere around the atom.
