### Multiplication and Division
When multiplying/dividing your answer has as many sig figs as the lowest number of sig figs in the input.

### Addition and Subtraction
When adding and subtracting the answer can only be as precise as the least precise number you are adding. Eg. if you have 350 + 8 but it is 350 and not 350. Then the answer is rounded to 2 sig figs, 360 instead of 358. The number of *decimal points* is always whatever the lowest value is, regardless of the significant figures in the result. eg 550.0 + 450.0 = 1000.0 not 1000.
