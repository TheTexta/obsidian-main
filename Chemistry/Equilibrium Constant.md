Refers to the $K$ value, which describes the relationship of product concentration to reactant concentration.

$$
aA(g) + bB(g) \rightleftharpoons cC(g) + dD(g)
$$
$$
K_c = \frac{[C]^c \cdot [D]^d}{[A]^a \cdot [B]^b}
$$

Even with [[equilibrium shifts]], the $K$ value works such that the value will remain constant, so long as there isn't a temperature shift.
