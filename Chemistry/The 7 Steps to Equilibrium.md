1. Write the [[Equilibrium Constant|Equilibrium Constant]], $K$, *exclude $(l)$ and $(s)$ substances*. 
2. Calculate initial concentrations of the substances
3. Find $Q$ and compare to $K$. State which direction the reaction will proceed
4. Write the equilibrium concentrations in terms of x by setting up the [[RICE table]]
5. Substitute the value of E in the [[RICE table]] into the $K$ equation. Solve for x
6. Use the x value to find the equilibrium concentrations of the substances
7. Sub the calculated equilibrium concentration into the $Q$ expression and check if it matches the $K$ value.
