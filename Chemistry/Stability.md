Stability::[[Orbitals]] where the [[subshells]] are all all half full are relatively stable compared to previous arrangements, where some [[Orbitals]] are empty. Most stable when subshell is completely full. **Empty > Full > Half Full > Partially Full** in stability. *Except for S [[Orbitals]] which are always considered stable due to there small size*
