Galvanic Cells::Where two metals undergo a [[Redox Reactions|redox reaction]] where [[Electron|electrons]] continuously flow from one side to the other a [[current]] is generated creating a battery made up of these galvanic cells. The electrons flow to the side where the metal is higher on the [[reduction potentials table]]. The [[voltage]] of the cells is determined by the difference as indicated by the charges on the table. The cells have a [[salt bridge]] to allow for the continuously flow of [[Electron|electrons]], otherwise the flow would stop and the [[Redox Reactions|redox reaction]] would finish. The [[salt bridge]] works by replacing the compounds which are lost by reduction on the reduction side or for the oxidisation side by neutralising the positively charged [[ion|ions]] left by there accompanying electrons being transferred over to the reduction side.
