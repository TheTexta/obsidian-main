The change in kinetic energy resulting from a reaction - $\Delta H$. Making bonds will release energy and create $-\Delta H$ but still require some [[Activation Energy]]. Breaking bonds will absorb energy over the entire process and as such requires $+\Delta H$ to add to the reaction. 


## Formula derivation
Since
$$
\Delta H  = -q_{surroundings}
$$
then:
$$
\Delta H  = {-m*c*T_{surroundings}}
$$
## Formula
$$
\Delta H  = {-m*c*T}
$$

Where 
* m = mass
* c = [[Specific Heat Capacity]]
* T = temperature change
* $\Delta H$ = Enthalpy Change

## Alt formula for J per mol
$$
 \frac{\Delta H}{mol}  = \frac{-m*c*T}{n}
$$
Where n represents the mols of the chemical in the system
