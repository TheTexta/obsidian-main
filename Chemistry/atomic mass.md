Atomic mass is the "weight" of an element. It is the number of [[proton|protons]] + number of [[electron|electrons]] in an [[element]]. The [[average atomic mass]] is different to the true atomic mass, as it is the average of the atomic masses of the element found in nature which include all [[isotope|isotopes]] of that [[element]].
