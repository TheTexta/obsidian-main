A combustion reaction occurs when a [[Compound]] or [[element]], typically a [[hydrocarbon]], reacts with oxygen. In the case where the reaction is of a [[hydrocarbon]], the reaction will always be carbon dioxide and water.

## When is a combustion reaction complete?
If a combustion reaction is complete on a [[hydrocarbon]], the resulting products will be carbon dioxide and dihydrogen monoxide (water). If the reaction is incomplete the resulting products will be carbon monoxide and water, or some other variation lacking oxygen. Visually, a incomplete combustion reaction can be identified through observing the colour of the flame. An orange flame is an incomplete reaction, a blue is complete. Smoke is only produced in an incomplete reaction.
