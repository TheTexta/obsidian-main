A substance or particle used to speed up the reaction by providing an additional pathway for the reaction to take place which requires less [[activation energy]] to begin but still the same overall energy. Catalysts are particles which are reacted then removed in a whole state from a reaction. They are *not* the same as [[Reaction Intermediate]]s which form during a reaction, instead they are always added before the beginning of a reaction and always come out the same way they were put in in the next [[elementary step]]. They never bond with the reactants. If a particle comes out unchanged in a given reaction it is generally a catalyst and *not a product.*
