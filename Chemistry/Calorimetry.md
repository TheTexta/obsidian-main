The process of measuring energy changes in reactions. By measuring the temperature in the space around the reaction one can infer the type ([[Endothermic Reactions]] or [[Exothermic Reactions]]) and specific energy ([[Enthalpy Change]]) of a reaction by measuring the change in [[Temperature]].

In calorimetry the reactants are known as the *system* by measuring the *surroundings* of the *system* one can infer the [[Enthalpy Change]] of the *system*. The *surrounding* is always the liquid in the surroundings of the reaction, represented by $q$, is the energy gained/loss by the reaction. With the [[Enthalpy Change]] formula you can measure the enthalpy change of the *system* if you know the specific heat capacity of the *surroundings*. *If a weight is not given for the dissolved substance, assume same weight as the solution.*
