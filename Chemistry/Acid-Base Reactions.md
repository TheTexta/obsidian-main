An acid base reaction occurs when an [[Acid]] compound reacts with a [[basic]] compound. The resulting chemical is a salt + water product. Acid base reactions can be used in [[titration]] to determine the concentration of an unknown product (the titrate) through the addition of a known product (the titrant). 

The [[Bronsted-Lowry]] theory states that [[acid|acids]] are hydrogen donors and [[base|bases]] are hydrogen ion acceptors.

## Ionisation vs Dissociation in water
[[ionisation]] is different from [[dissociation]] but in the context of the course here they are the same. [[Ionisation]] is when a molecules [[covalent bonds]] are broken and the [[compound]] splits apart forming charged [[ion|ions]]. [[Dissociation]] is when a compounds [[ionic bonds]] are broken and it splits apart into the [[ion|ions]] it already consists of. 

When acids dissolve they donate hydrogen ions and bases dissolve to accept hydroxide. [[Strong acids]] completely ionise in water, [[weak acids|weak]] do not. [[Strong bases]] almost completely ionise in water, [[weak bases]] do not.

## Acid and Base Strength vs. Concentration
**Concentration** is a ratio of the amount of [[solute]] to the amount of [[solvent]] in a solution while **strength** is the degree of [[ionisation]] / [[dissociation]] of the [[acid]] / [[base]] in aqueous sol. measured with [[K value]]. 

##### Concentration
Measured in mol/L it is the ratio of [[solute]] to [[solvent]] in a solution. Its important to note that [[pH]] is related to concentration not strength. 
#### Strength
Strength is the extent to which [[ionisation]] and [[dissociation]] occur in [[acid]] / [[base]] solutions. It can be measured using the [[K value]]. [[Percent ionisation]] is used to measure strength as well. *Why acids are strong or weak is beyond the scope of the course.*

## In Equilibrium or Complete?
Some [[reactions]] are one way and complete others fall into [[equilibrium]]. *[[Strong acids]]/[[Strong bases|bases]]* always fully ionise and are one way $\ce{->}$ while [[weak acids]]/[[weak bases|bases]] are two way $\ce{<=>}$.
