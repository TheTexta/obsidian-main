An acid is a compound with a [[pH]] < 7. All acids comprise of [[Compound|compounds]] with excess $H^+$ ions. Acids are defined as being "Hydrogen containing substances capable of donating excess [[Proton|protons]] to another substance". Remember H+ is different to H. H+ refers to a hydrogen [[ion]] with less [[Electron|electrons]] giving it its positive charge. 

An acid is a $H^+$ donor. They have hydrogen molecules readily available for other atoms to accept and bond with. Water always accepts the hydrogen ions which acids release in aqueous form.

### New Stuff
[[Bronsted-Lowry]] says that acid is a hydrogen ion donor and a base is a hydrogen ion acceptor.
