Oxidisation number::The hypothetical charge of an atom if all its bonds to other atoms were fully ionic. The number of electrons an atom can donate or accept to form a maximum number of bonds. $\text{number of electrons in outer shell neutrally} - \text{number of electrons in outer shell now} = \text{oxidisation number}$
To determine whether one atom receives [[Electron|electrons]] over another in a [[Ionic Bonds|bonding situation]], refer to the *upright* trend on the periodic table. 

Rules:
- The oxidation state of an atom in its *elemental form is 0*.
- For *monatomic ions*, the oxidation state is equal to the *charge of the ion*.
- Oxygen usually has an oxidation state of -2 in compounds (except in *peroxides* where it's -1, and in OF2 where it's +2 due to fluorine's higher electronegativity (dont need to know this one)).
- Hydrogen has an oxidation state of +1 when bonded to nonmetals and -1 when bonded to metals.
- The sum of the oxidation states in a neutral compound is 0, and in a polyatomic ion is equal to the charge of the ion.
- Criss cross rule for polyatomic
