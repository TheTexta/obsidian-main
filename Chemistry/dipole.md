The separation of charge, commonly used when referring to the separation of charge seen in molecules with partial charges due to small [[electronegativity]] differences. 

# Visual representations of dipoles
There are two ways to indicate dipole on a given element. Arrows and deltas represent the pull of the electron from one side to the other. The partially negative side receiving "more" electrons then the other.
