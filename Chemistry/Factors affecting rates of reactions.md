**There are too main mechanisms which affect rates of reactions. Either you can affect the efficiency of the reaction or the number of total reactions which occur in a given time**
### Nature of Reactants
##### State of Matter
Gasses have higher avg KE then there solid / liquid form counterparts.
##### Ionic Reactants
If the reacts are in ionic aqueous form they will react faster then there otherwise non ionic dry equivalents.
##### Bond Types
Ionically bonded compounds react faster then molecular ones. Because covalent bonds are stronger then ionic.
##### Bond Strength
Reactions involving the breakage of weaker [[Covalent bonds|bonds]] are faster then stronger [[Covalent bonds|bond]] (i.e. double/triple bonds between carbons)
##### Number of Molecules / Molecule Size
As the number of bonds in a reactant increases, so too does the time taken to dismantle such bonds.
##### Strength of Acid
[[Strong Acids]] which are always fully ionised in there solutions react faster then partially ionised [[weak acids]] in a sol. 
##### Reactivity of a Metal
[[metallic compounds|Metals]] with low [[electronegativity]] react quicker then higher as they have less inclination to stay together, making them more likely to give up an [[electron]].
### Surface Area of Solid Reactants
The average surface area of solid reactants affects the frequency at which collisions take place. Powdered solids are more efficient at reacting then there whole counterparts due to higher surface area of contact between the two reactants
### Concentration of reactants
Reactants with a higher concentration react at a higher frequency due to increase relative surface area for reactions to take place. This only works if the reactant is the [[rate determining step]].
### Catalysts
[[Catalyst]], in a way, *decrease* the [[Activation Energy]] required for a reaction, making it more efficient. *however they don't actually decrease the activation energy of the original reaction, they just provide a more efficient pathway which requires less [[activation energy]], meaning that both reactions occur at the same time*
### Temperature of the Reaction System
In general, as [[Temperature]] increases, rate which particles collide increase, temperature also increases the rate of successful collisions and in turn reactions (more [[Force]] = higher chance of particle collisions leading to bonds as they get close enough to break past the resistance and instead become attracted - see [[electromagnetism]]).
