There are several types of chemical reaction types in chemistry. [[Single Displacement Reactions]] and [[Double Displacement Reactions]], [[Combustion]], [[Decomposition]], [[Synthesis]], [[Acid-Base Reactions]], [[Precipitation]], [[redox]] and [[Acid-Base Titration]] reactions are all common reactions seen in chemistry.

## Reaction Observation
Reactions can be observed through a variety of perspectives. The most common changes observed are colour, heat and mass changes. 

## Reaction Mechanisms
Reactions mostly occur by a series of elementary steps in an overall sequence, called reaction mechanisms. Each elementary step is simple and involves no more then two reacting particles. Most elementary steps of reactions involve 1 reacting particle ([[unimolecular]]) ones involving 2 reacting particles are called [[bimolecular]]. These stages form [[Reaction Intermediate]]s which are further reacted to form the final product of a reaction. This is possible to still summarise as a full reaction with a given [[enthalpy change]] because of [[hess's law]]. The slowest elementary step in a reaction is called the [[rate determining step]].
