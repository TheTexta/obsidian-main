There are several types of chemical reaction types in chemistry. [[Single Displacement Reactions]] and [[Double Displacement Reactions]], [[combustion]], [[Decomposition]], [[Synthesis]], [[Acid-Base Reactions]], [[precipitation]], [[redox]] and [[acid-base titration]] reactions are all common reactions seen in chemistry.

## Reaction Observation
Reactions can be observed through a variety of perspectives. The most common changes observed are colour, heat and mass changes.
