The [[Enthalpy Change]] of a chemical equation is a sum of all the smaller [[Reactions|reactions]] enthalpy's which make up the larger one. If you can break a reaction down into individual steps, the sum of those individual steps enthalpy's is the sum of the whole reaction at once.

## Formula
$$
\Delta H_{net} = \sum{\Delta H_r}
