The [[Enthalpy Change]] of a chemical equation is a sum of all the smaller [[Reactions|reactions]] enthalpy's which make up the larger one. If you can break a reaction down into individual steps, the sum of those individual steps enthalpy's is the sum of the whole reaction at once. You can also get a complex reaction and break it into its [[elementary steps]] using hess's law as a guide for the [[enthalpy change]] of the final reaction.

## Formula
$$
\Delta H_{net} = \sum{\Delta H_r}
