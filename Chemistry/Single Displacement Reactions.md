Single displacement [[reactions]] occur when a compound is mixed with an [[element]] which is more reactive then the one in the compound. You can determine if a single displacement [[Reactions|reaction]] will occur based upon the activity series which ranks the reactivity of various elements. if the single [[element]] is more reactive then one of the components of the [[compound]] then the displacement reaction will occur.
