In a redox (reduction-oxidation) reaction, two processes occur simultaneously: one species is [[oxidisation|oxidised]] (loses [[Electron|electrons]]), and another is [[reduction|reduced]] (gains [[Electron|electrons]]). The substance that loses [[electron|electrons]] is known as the [[reducing agent]] (or reductant) because it donates electrons to another substance, thereby [[reduction|reducing]] it. Conversely, the substance that gains electrons is known as the [[oxidising agent]] (or oxidant) because it causes another substance to be [[oxidisation|oxidised]] by accepting electrons from it.
