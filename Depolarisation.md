	Depolarisation::A reduction in the electric potential across a membrane such that the inner surface of a membrane becomes much less negative when compared to the outer surface. Occurs when the membrane is stimulated and sodium ions flow in to the cell. if the stimulus intensity exceeds the [[excitatory threshold]] an [[action potential]] is created and a [[Neural Impulses]] is propagated.
