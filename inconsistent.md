A [[system of linear equations]] with no [[Solution to a System|solution]] is called inconsistent. An inconsistent system of linear equations can be identified when the [[augmented matrix]] operated on (through [[Elementary Row Operations]]) or not produces a all zero line with a nonzero constant.

#### Example
$$\begin{pmatrix}  
1 & -1 & 1& |*\\  
0 & 1 & 0&|*\\
0 & 0 & 0&|5\\
\end{pmatrix}$$
where the last row translates to $0x+0y+0z=5$ which is a [[contradiction]] therefor the system is [[Inconsistent]]
