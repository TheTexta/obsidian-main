Absolute threshold::the minimum stimulation necessary to detect a particular stimulus (light, sound, pressure, taste, or odour) **50%** of the time.

Methods:
1. Limits - You take an increasingly limiting stimulus and measure when you can detect it 50% of the time. 
2. Right and wrong - YOu present identical stimuli repeatedly, either single stimuli at the the threshold or pairs of stimuli that are very similiar. 
3. Ajustment - You adjust a comparison stimulus until it apeasrs identical to the standard stimulus.
