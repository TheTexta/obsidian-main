Why is its cell membrane crucial for metabolism::Selective Permeability, Energy Production (ATP), compartmentalisation.
###### Metabolism is basically redox reactions:
- electrons flowing from reduced forms of a chemical to an oxidised form. energy is released in these reactions. 
- All of bacterial metabolism is based on pairing electron acceptors with electron donors
- Toward arrow indicates energy released with the length correlating with the amount of energy released.

### Evolution of metabolism

- The atmosphere contains $CH_2O$, Amino acids, nucleotides.
- Fermentation ($CH_2O->CH_2O'+2ATP$) - occurs through [[the electron transport chain]] process
	- Glycolysis converts glucose to pyruvate plus ATP which through fermentation converts to ethanol + a component for the original glycolysis reaction but this fermentation process *does not generate much energy.* 2 ATP
	- 1a) $\text{Glucose} + ADP +NAD ->\text{pyruvate} + \text{NADH} + ATP$
	- 1b) $\text{pyruvate} + \text{NADH} -> \text{lactate} + NAD+$ ([[Redox Reactions|redox reaction]])
- Respiration (Evolved later)
	- $CH_4+SO_4^-->HCO_3^-+HS^-+ATP$ (much more then 2 ATP)
- [[Photosynthesis]]
	- $CO_2+{HS}^-->CH_2O+S$ (any generic sugar)
- [[Oxygenic Photosynthesis]] (cyanobacteria first to do this)
	- $CO_2+H_2O->CH_2O+O_2$
	- Which increased the oxygen in the atmosphere from 0.0001%-> 21% today
- Aerobic Respiration (cyanobacteria first to do this)
	- ${CH_2O}+{O_2}{-->}{CO_2}+{H_2O}+ ~36 \text{ATP}$ 

##### The Winogradsky column
A simple method for separating and visualising the diverse metabolic systems found in a community of prokaryotes. Take some pound water and let it sit basically. The tope half reactions are [[autotroph|autotrophic]] and the bottom half are [[heterotroph|heterotrophic]].
