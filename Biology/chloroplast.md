chloroplast evolved from::[[endosymbiotic theory|endosymbiosis]] - a [[heterotroph|heterotrophic]] [[eukaryotes|eukaryote]] engulfing a [[cyanobacteria|cyanobacterium]]
chloroplast have a special membrane::at least a double membrane like mitochondria
chloroplast replicate::by fission, independently of cell division

how did they spread to most eukaryote supergroups:
- some eukaryotes evolve photosynthesis on their own
	- but all photoynthetic eukaryotes use chloroplasts and both PS! and PSII evolved in bacteria
- single origin in eukarototes but then was lost in many lineages
	- but roots dont support this
- multiple events of endosymbiosis
	- doesnt explain number of membranes
- endosymbiosis leading to chloroplasts first occured in common ancestor of Plantae
	- other groups acquired chloroplasts via secondary endosymbiosis.
