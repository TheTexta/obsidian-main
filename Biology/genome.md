A genome is the complete set of an organisms genetic material, including all of its genes and non-coding (as in do not code for protein) sequences of [[DNA]]. Contains information needed for the growth, development and functioning of an organism. genomes are organised into [[Chromosome]]s. within the genome specific sequences of [[DNA]] code for proteins which carry out most of the biological functionings within cells.

TLDR: The genome is the blueprint for an [[organism]] that contains all the information needed for its development and functioning.
