#biol111 
- tiny [[protein]] package containing a [[DNA]] or [[RNA]] [[genome]]
- not considered a [[cell]] (no [[cytoplasm]], no [[ribosome|ribosomes]]...)
- cannot replicate without a host cell
- All forms of life are infected by viruses; [[LUCA]] probably had viruses
- all viruses use host resources ([[nucliotides|nucleotides]], [[amino acid|amino acids]]) to build more copies of themselves.
- some viruses are more [[virulent]] than others
- a [[phage]] is a virus that infects [[bacteria]] or [[archaea]]
- very small but super abundant (unit wise viruses make up the majority of microbes)
- $10^{30}$ viruses in the ocean and $10^{23}$ new infections happen every second

### Example of a eukaryotic virus
- Viral particle is made up of
	- genetic material single-stranded RNA
	- a protein coat (capsid)
	- lipid bilayer, 3 membrane proteins
- functionings
	- Virus enters host cell
	- replicates using host resources to make copies of itself
		- using ribosomes of the host cell
- nucleotide identity
	- 96% Bat CoV
	- 91% Pangolin CoV
	- 50% cold
- spread to humans from other animals and can still infect other animals
- adaptation to one animal species can bring tradeoffs for infecting another
	- shown by evolving covid for a ferret/mink
	- resulted in a virus less infectious to humans
