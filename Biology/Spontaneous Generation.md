A theory for the creation of life on earth (which started with [[microbes]]). Pasteur showed that spontaneous life creation was impossible but its possible simple creatures could arise spontaneously in uninhabited early earth.
This theory requires:
- **Either** that complex organism like [[bacteria]] should arise spontaneously by some natural process of self-organisation (big jump)
- **Or** that there is a continuous series of entities linking the unambiguously chemical with the indisputably living, with evolution through natural selection at some point taking over from self assembly. 

To chemical processes need to happen for life to be possible
- growth
- production

- For life to evolve from prebiotic chemistry we need one more process
	- inheritance: repoduction gives rise to products that resemble their parents more closely then they resemble random members of the same population.

There are then two possible routes for the origin of life.
- genetics (inheritance, information) first
- [[Metabolism]] (growth, reproduction) first
##### Evidence of spontaneous generation
Experiment by Stanley Miller, Harold Urey showed that in conditions typical of earth atmosphere, small basic biomolecules would form (amino acids, etc). Basically the building blocks of life through these abiotic conditions.

### Genetics First - [[RNA]] world
- no reasonable pathway leading from a dilute solution of small molecules to a full fledged DNA-protein cell has ever been found
- RNA is replicated by RNA polymerases. small RNA replicators exist today as viruses.
- RNA molecules can replicate without cells when they are provided with raw material and a replicase
- RNA can act as an enzyme ([[ribozyme]]) - similar to protein enzymes
- Ribozymes catalyze reactions, including reactions that modify the state of other RNA molecules
- RNA uniquely combines the capacity to replicate genetic information and capacity to direct metabolism

The factors above lead to the theory of the RNA world. An early ocean populated by self replicating RNA strands from which cells and eventually all living organisms descended.

### Metabolism First
What metabolic strategies would have been possible on early Earth?
Photosynthesis?

Chemical disequilibrium at a hydrothermal vent. Energy generated by hydrothermal fields could have propagated early metabolism. Check the [[Metabolism]] note for details of how metabolism evolved and why this theory most likely holds most true.
