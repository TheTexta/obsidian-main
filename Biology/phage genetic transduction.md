[[phage|phages]] can be a vector of HGT through a process of transduction

### Process of transduction
- black is [[cell membrane]] green is [[genome]] inside
- [[phage]] is yellow, [[genome]] is red
- infect host [[bacteria|bacterial]] cell by inserting [[genome]]
- it replicates its [[dna]]
- [[lysis|lyses]] the hosts [[genome]]
- makes copies of its own genome
- packages these [[dna]] pieces into new packages which burst the cell
- transducing [[phage]] contains host [[dna]]
- transducing [[phage]] can inject host [[dna]] into the transduced cell
- very rare for this all to happen

### Example
vibrio cholerae + phage
Lytic cycle - phages are killing the vibrio cholerae
thorugh the lysogeneic cycle.
