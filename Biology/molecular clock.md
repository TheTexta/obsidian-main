The idea that mutations accumulate in a roughly clocklike fashion. meaning there is a correlation between the amount of time that has passed and the number of mutations. So we can measure the distance in number of nucleotide substitutions. 

### Example
Covid mutations appear once every 2 weeks which allows us to fit a molecular clock and build "time trees"
