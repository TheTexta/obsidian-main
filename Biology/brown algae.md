- multicellular marine organism
- individual - thallus (not called a plant) - no complex vascular system
- brown colour from carotenoid pigment 
- tallest seaweed is: kelp - 80m.

Kelp:
- >120 species
- fastest growth rate
- 3.5m / week
- final height up to 80m

kelp alternate between two multicellular life stages: multicellular haploid (n) form (gameotophyte) & multicellular diploid (2n) sporophyte
- gametophytes - produce gametes by mitosis
- sporophytes - produce spores by meiosis
