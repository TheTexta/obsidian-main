#### Causes of speciation
- reduced gene flow between two lineages
	- geographic separation
	- local physical separation (canopy vs ground floor)
	- temporal separation (flowering early vs late in season)
- Different evolution between lineages - differing [[natural selection]]
	- via different selection (for red flowers in one population and yellow in the other - separate morphs within the same species)
	- pollinators select for colour
- [[genetic drift]] - differentiation by chance (more applicable in smaller populations)
- reproductive isolation - a measure of reproductive isolation
	- species no longer encounter each other
	- no longer recognise each other as mates (despite ability to do so)
	- physically or genetically unable to produce viable offspring
