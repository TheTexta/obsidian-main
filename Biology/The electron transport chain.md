- Electrons can be passed along a series of molecules in this way, always "downhill" from more electropositive to more electronegative molecules - releasing energy in the process. 
- The energy released by the fall in potential energy can be harvested to do work in the cell. 

###### Chemiosmotic energy storage by membranes
- Lipid bilayer membranes are impermeable to ions: they separate the electrical charge inside from outside.
- the charge imbalance is created by redox reactions of the electron transport chain that pump protons (H+) from the inside to outside.
- These protons tend to return spontaneously because of an imbalance
- when they return the pass through the [[ATP synthase]] channel which turns and drives the oxidative phosphorylation of ADP to ATP.
- This creates a high energy phosphate bond that can then be hydrolysed to support biosynthesis.
- This process happens accross the cell membrane of a Bacteria molecule

Energy released by the electron transport chain is used to pump protons across the plasma membrane to create an electrochemical gradient. An imbalance of hydrogen + ions allows for the synthesisation of ATP.![[Screenshot 2024-09-26 at 12.48.01 AM.png]]
