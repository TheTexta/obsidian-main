Transfer of genes across tree through process like [[endosymbiotic theory|endosymbiosis]] rather then through downwards through [[mutation]]. 

Forms of HGT:
- [[endosymbiotic theory]]
- genes from the [[symbiont]] [[genome]] are transferred into the host genome
- [[phage genetic transduction]] - [[phage|phages]] can be a vector of HGT through a process of transduction
