LUCA::last universal common ancestor of all living organisms also known as the Most Recent Universal Common Ancestor.

LUCA divided to give rise to two daughter cells
- Bacterias greatest ancestor
- Archaeas greatest ancestor

### What was luca like
Information (needed a way to store and copy DNA)
- DNA genome
- Single circular molecule
- Helicase
- DNA polymerase - to replicate the DNA

Tranfer (needed all the basic mechanisms of transcription and translation):
- DNA-dependent RNA polymerase
- tRNAs
- [[ribosome]]

[[Metabolism]]: (Probably [[anaerobic]])
- TCA cycle and [[The electron transport chain|electron transport chain]] to make ATP and NADH
- Ability to synthesise all 4 bases of [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], and most [[amino acids|amino acids]]
