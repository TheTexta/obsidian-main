#biol111 
a [[virus]] which infects [[bacteria]] or [[archaea]]

- highly diverse (shape, size, gene content)
- linear double stranded [[DNA]], 3,000 to 500,000 [[Nucleotide Bases|base pairs]]. 
- can be a vector of [[horizontal gene transfer]] through a process of [[transduction]] - [[phage genetic transduction]]

### Phages are important in ecosystems
- vectors of [[horizontal gene transfer|HGT]] through [[phage genetic transduction]]
- often target the most abundant bacteria and keep them in check (kill the winner)
	- could terminate the [[cyanobacteria]] blooms
	- keep [[pathogen|pathogens]] like *V. cholerae* under control

### [[Coevolution]]
- [[phage|phages]] and [[bacteria]] mutually impose selective pressures - evolution of one affects the other.
- which cycles adaptation and counter-adaptation
- this can create evolutionary tradeoffs ie bacteria resistant to phages but unable to infect any other bodies.

###### Infection process affected by coevolution
- phage attaches to a receptor protein on the bacterial surface
- mutations in the receptor gene can confer resistance to the phage
- phages are then under selection to bind the mutator receptor
