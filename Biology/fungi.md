### Phylogeny
- phylogeny::Fungi are one of 3 major lineages of large terrestrial [[eukaryotes]]
- few fossils hard to study [[evolution]]
- first fungi 800-1000 mya
- colonised land 500 mya (before [[plants]])
### Types of Fungi
- [[yeast]]
- there are humungous multi celluar fungi
	- [[humungous fungus]] $9km^2$
- disease
	- athletes foot
	- yeast infections
	- jock itch
	- ring worm

### Importance of Fungi
- critical to ecosystem functioning
- humans and fungi
	- edible mushrooms
	- breakdown of sugars -> alcohol and co2
		- [[alcohol|alcohols]]
		- bread
		- soy sauce
		- cheese
	- mycotoxins
		- psychedelics
	- bioethanol
	- penicillin

### Features of fungi
- majority of fungus underground
- key feature::Ability to extract nutrients
- structure::single called or made of filament. no complex transport systems, *cell walls* (like [[plants]]) which contain [[chitin]] (like [[animals]])
	- [[yeast|yeasts]]
		- Single cells
		- to tell the difference between a [[yeast]] and a [[bacteria]]::[[bacteria]] are [[prokaryote|prokaryotes]] and do not have a membrane bound nucleus i.e. visible nucleus
		- fungi are [[eukaryotes]] so the nucleus is found::in a membrane
	- [[mycelium|mycelia]] - made of [[hyphae]] (long thin filaments) - refers to the [[hyphae]] found underground
	- [[hyphae]] 
		- separated by cross walls called [[septa]]
		- 100x thinner then the thinnest plant root
		- can pack together to form mushrooms
		- big nutrient absorbers
	- [[septa]] - separates hyphae with cross walls and have large pores that allow passage of nutrients, even nuclei
	- fungi is 99% water and the structure comes from turbopressure - water pushing outwards to give it shape and form.
- nutrition::absorb food indirectly from surroundings through secreted digestive enzymes which eat externally
	- thin [[hyphae]] - big absorbers
	- need for moisture makes them often [[symbiotic]]
	- plants photosynthesize, animals eat things, fungi secrete digestive enzymes externally
		- [[saprophytes]] - eats dead stuff
		- [[symbionts]]
	- novel methods of absorbing nutrients
	- key in C, N, P cycles
	- main decomposers of::cellulose and lignin (most abundant molecules on earth)

### [[ecology]]
- most famous symbiosis
	- lichen
		- fungi + algae or cyanobacteria
		- 20000 species
		- 6% of Earths surface
		- mutualism
	- mycorrihizae
		- 80% of angiosperms partner with fungi to get nutrient from soil
		- lack of patterns of this fungi can limit plant species distributions
### Reproduction
- reproduction of fungi is both::sexual and asexual and incredibly diverse modes of reproduction
- Asexual
	- fragmentation
	- during haploid phase
	- vegetative spores ([[conidia]])
	- produced on [[conidiophores]]
- Sexual - different from sex in animals (no fucking shit bro its a fucking mushroom)
	- one species can have::many mating types
	- individuals of compatible types fuse their::[[mycelium|mycelia]] to initiate sexual cycle (anasomosis/plasmogamy)
	- produces a [[dikaryotic]] [[mycelium]]
	- [[basidia]] - specialised end cells of mushroom gills
	- process of sexual reproduction::nuclei fuse -> [[meiosis]] -> spores
- Dispersal: spores
	- unlike [[hyphae|hyphae]], spores tolerate dry conditions
	- important for dispersal
	- small size facilitates airborne dispersal
