The theory that two separate cells came together to form a single complex organism originally developed by [[Lynn Margulis]] in the 1970s.

### Endosymbiotic Theory and Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT)
- Endosymbiosis is a special case of [[horizontal gene transfer|HGT]] involving and entire genome

### Evidence?
- Morphological similarity
- DNA similarity (molecular phylogenetics
	- Dootlittle and Bonen compare cyanobacteria 16S rRNA with eukaryotic algae's 18S rRNA
	- Algae: nuclear rRNA is eukaryotic; chloroplast is cyanobacterial
	- Spirochete and Flagella have no molecular evidence of similarity only morphological evidence
