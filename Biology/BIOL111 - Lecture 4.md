Fungi
- [[yeast]]
- there are humungous multi celluar fungi
	- [[humungous fungus]] $9km^2$
- majority of fungus underground
- disease
	- athletes foot
	- yeast infections
	- jock itch
	- ring worm
- critical to ecosystem functioning
- wide range of human uses
- humans and fungi
	- edible mushrooms
	- breakdown of sugars -> alcohol and co2
		- alchohols
		- bread
		- soy sauce
		- cheese
	- mycotoxins
		- psychedelics
	- bioethanol
	- fungal diseases for humans
	- penycilin

Features of fungi
- structure: single called or made of filament. no complex transport systems, cell walls which contain chitin
	- yeasts - single cells (cell wall)
	- bacteria - prokaryotes (no membrane bound nucleus)
	- mycelia
		- mycelium - made of hypae (long thin filaments)
		- hyphae separated by cross walls called "septa"
		- septa have large pores that allow passage of nutrients, even nuclei
		- hypae - 100x thinner then the thinnest plant root
			- can pack together to form mushrooms
		- 
- nutrition: absorb food indrectly from surroundings
	- thin hypae - big absorbers
	- need for moisture
	- plants photosynthesize, animals eat things, fungi secrete digestive enzumes externally
		- saprophytes (dead stuff)
		- symbionts
	- novel methods of absorbing nutrients
	- key in C, N, P cycles
	- main decomposers of cellulose and lignin (most abundant molecules on earth)
	- ecology
		- most famous symbiosis
			- lichen
				- fungi + algae or cyanobacteria
				- 20000 species
				- 6% of Earths surface
				- mutualism
			- mycorrihizae
				- 80% of angiosperms partner with fungi to get nutrient from soil
				- lack of patterns of this fungi can limit plant species distributions
- reproduction: sexual asexual
	- Asexual
		- fragmentation
		- during haploid phase
		- vegetative spores (conidia)
		- produced on conidiophores
	- sexual
		- very different from sex in animals
		- one species can have  many mating types
		- individiduals of compatible types fuse thheir mycelia to initiate sexual cycle (anasomosis/plasmogamy)
		- produces a dikaryotic mycelium
		- basidia - specialised end cells of mushroom gills
		- nuclei fuse -> meiosis -> spores
- dispersal: spores
	- unlike hyphae, spores tolerate dry conditions
	- im;ortant for disperal
	- small size facitliiates airborne dispersal
