##### The history of the tree of life
- Aristotle's Scala naturae, 400 BCE was the first usage of taxonomy. 
- Linnaeus' Systemae Naturae, 1735
- First tree depictions
	- [[Phylogeny]] began in 1809 with Lamarck who believed adaptations were acquired
	- evolved in 1837 with Darwin who developed a tree based on adaptations via natural selection
- [[Morphology]], [[metabolism]] has limited information
- [[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular phylogeny]] provides the perfect tool to classify [[microbes]]
	- The best gene to build a tree of life is the [[rRNA|Ribosomal RNA]]
	- [[Carl Woese]] 1970s choose the [[rRNA|ribosomal RNA]] to develop the tree of life. 
	- [[ribosome|Ribosomes]] are universally conserved across all living things
- The discovery of Archaea gave way to the [[three-domain system]]
	- Woese continues to add branches to the tree.
	- [[Halophilic bacteria]] and [[thermoacidophiles]] turn out to be [[Archaea]] (not [[bacteria]])
	- Distinctness of [[Archaea]] also supported by weird [[phospholipids]] of a particular chemical structure.
- As more data was added to the tree a new model began to challenge the [[three-domain system]] hypothesis

##### Understanding tree diagrams
The [[prokaryote|prokaryotes]] are not [[monophyly|monophyletic]] so they are not included on the tree. When a group has a name *in game* but don't share a real common ancestor they are called [[paraphyletic]]. When a group has two independent origins it is [[polyphyletic]]

###### Example
Reptiles are [[paraphyletic]] because they do not include the birds group (aves) so in a sense there classification isn't real.

##### How to interpret the tree of life
"More closely related" is the same as saying "things which diverged most recently." things closest to the tip in the same family are more closely related then that which is closer to the roots. The closer to the tip the common ancestor of the two organisms in question the more related those two organisms are.

###### Example interpretation
green alga is more closely related to moss then red alga because there common ancestor is less far back along the tree.

A has a different grouping for BDE which includes C in the grouping. Despite all the diagrams describing the same tree structure, a depicts a different structure to the rest which is why it is the outlier.
