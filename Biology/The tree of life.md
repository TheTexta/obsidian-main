##### The history of the tree of life (just a big [[Phylogeny]])
- Aristotle's Scala naturae, 400 BCE was the first usage of taxonomy. 
- Linnaeus' Systemae Naturae, 1735
- First tree depictions
	- [[Phylogeny]] began in 1809 with Lamarck who believed adaptations were acquired
	- evolved in 1837 with Darwin who developed a tree based on adaptations via natural selection
- [[Morphology]], [[metabolism]] has limited information
- [[Molecular phylogenetics|Molecular phylogeny]] provides the perfect tool to classify [[microbes]]
	- The best gene to build a tree of life is the [[rRNA|Ribosomal RNA]]
	- [[Carl Woese]] 1970s choose the [[rRNA|ribosomal RNA]] to develop the tree of life. 
	- [[ribosome|Ribosomes]] are universally conserved across all living things
- The discovery of Archaea gave way to the [[three-domain system]]
	- [[Carl Woese|Woese]] continues to add branches to the tree.
	- [[Halophilic bacteria]] and [[thermoacidophiles]] turn out to be [[archaea]] (not [[bacteria]])
	- Distinctness of [[archaea]] also supported by weird [[phospholipids]] of a particular chemical structure.
- As more data was added to the tree a new model began to challenge the [[three-domain system]] hypothesis - the [[Eocyte hypothesis]]
	- The [[Eocyte hypothesis]] described [[eukaryotes]] as a offspring of [[archaea]] rather then sharing a common ancestor with it.
	- This hypothesis gained increasingly more support into the 2010s with DNA sequencing of deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the Arctic Sea known as "Loki's castle." 
		- Lokiarchaeota
		- Thorachaeota
		- Odinarchaeta
	- This evidence added further evidence that [[Eukarya]] emerged from within [[archaea]]
	- These were culture isolated sequences. It took 12 years to enrich the culture to a point where the a sample was properly grown. 
		- Lokiachaea prometheoachaeum syntrophicum was a co culture with another achaean and bacteria which partly explains why it was so hard to cultivate. It doesn't have organelle structure but very complex [[morphology]]
		- These structure were [[syntrophy|syntrophic]] meaning they cross fed.
		- The way the [[archaea]] engulfed the [[bacteria]] provides a possible model for how [[mitochondria]] may have developed from these two cells entanglement. If we extrapolate the entanglement shown in these incredibly old cells it would be reasonable that todays [[mitochondria]] came from such an entanglement process. Although this evidence is only from the past 10 years the theory dates back to the 1970s with [[Lynn Margulis]] [[endosymbiotic theory]]
- [[LUCA]] (last universal common ancestor of all living organisms)
	- Archaea and Bacteria are the two daughter cells of LUCA
	- Eukaryotes came about through a process of endosymbiosis. A fusion of bacteria and Archaea.
##### Updating the tree of life
- Ciccarelli et al. 2006
	- 191 genomes included in the tree
	- based on an alignment of 31 genes (mostly ribosomal) present in 1 copy per genome

##### Problems with the tree
- If a tree is based on ~100 [[gene|genes]], it may not represent the evolutionary history of the other ~2000 genes in a typical [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] [[genome]]
- Horizontal processes (such as [[endosymbiotic theory|endosymbiosis]] a form of [[horizontal gene transfer|HGT]]) are not easily represented by a vertical tree. Cross branch interactions not properly depicted on a tree diagram.
