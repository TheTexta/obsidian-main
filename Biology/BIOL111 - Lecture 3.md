- [[taxa]]
- [[Phylogeny]]
- morphoism
- you cannot say one thing is more evolved then another. all currently surviving species are equally as evolved regardless of unique features. 
- two species cant be more primitive if they are both still existing, same argument as above
- a species *lineage* can be more primitive if a group has less branches then another
- what causes diversity?
	- mutation rates
	- geographic changes
- [[speciation]]
- why are there so many species of x?
	- possible explanations are all things which promote [[speciation]]
		- increased likliehoo of reduced geneflow among lineages
			- large geographical range
			- area with high separation (island achelpelago)
			- lots of locally isolated habitats
		- increased likihood of differing selection and or response to selection
			- lifestyle leads to narrow niche (parasites with only 1 host species)
			- high mutation rates or short generation time
			- temporally stable (not fluctuating) environment
		- increased likelihood of reproductive isolation
			- mating system that favours reproductive isolation (strong [[Sexual Selection]])
			- prone to genome duplication
- Weevils
	- Most weevil species have a close association with a lineage of flowering plants
		- lifestyle leads to a narrow niche
		- locally isolated habitats
		- short generation time
- there are three responses to change: move, adapt or die
- [[Range shifts]]
- [[phenotypic plasticity]]
