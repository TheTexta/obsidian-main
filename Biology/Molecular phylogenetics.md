### History
Watson and Crick, 1953: "it has not escaped our notice that the specific pairings we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material." (basically as soon as [[DNA]] was discovered the idea it is copied was noticed)
- Crick, 1958
	- suggests the idea of [[protein]] [[taxonomy]]
- Pauling and Zuckerkandl, 1964
	- [[molecular clock]] - meaning 
	- based on [[haemoglobin]] [[protein]] sequences
- [[Bacteria]] are notoriously hard to classify
	- Linnaeus 1774: "chaos"
	- Haeckel 1866: *Monera* at the base of the tree, giving rise to more complex forms
	- Chatton 1937: [[prokaryote|Prokaryotes]] (smaller simpler cells) vs. [[eukaryotes|eukaryotes]] (bigger complexer)

### Phylogenetic methods
##### Distance based
This allows for the comparison of different species assuming a constant mutation time we can infer which species are most similar by understanding similar mutations would have to occur for them to have the same code. 

###### Example
if sequence a and b have 2 differences but sequences a and c have 8 - we put a and b together as nearest neighbours on a [[phylogenetic tree]]
##### Parsimony
The tree structure with the lowest total number of mutations.
