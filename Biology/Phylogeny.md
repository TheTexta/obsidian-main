##### Overview
A way of showing relationships between [[taxa]], usually [[species]]. They used to be made by morphology, physically observable characteristics. Nowadays made using [[dna]]. made based upon a [[hypothesis]], mapped based upon unknowables since we don't know the past of all [[organism|organisms]]. because of this some are better supported through evidence then others. The splits in the branches are aligned with a timeline at the bottom which describes the amount of time ago the split happened and the new groups were introduced. To find the common ancestor go back to the common node. 

You *cannot* see extinctions on a phylogeny diagram, therefor its impossible to compare diversification rates.

A branching tree depicting evolutionary (acestor-descendent) relationships among a group of organisms with a common ancestor.

##### Understanding phylogenies
The [[prokaryote|prokaryotes]] are not [[monophyly|monophyletic]] so they are not included on the tree. When a group has a name *in game* but don't share a real common ancestor they are called [[paraphyletic]]. When a group has two independent origins it is [[polyphyletic]]

###### Example
Reptiles are [[paraphyletic]] because they do not include the birds group (aves) so in a sense there classification isn't real.

##### How to interpret phylogenies
"More closely related" is the same as saying "things which diverged most recently." things closest to the tip in the same family are more closely related then that which is closer to the roots. The closer to the tip the common ancestor of the two organisms in question the more related those two organisms are.

###### Example interpretation
green alga is more closely related to moss then red alga because there common ancestor is less far back along the tree.

A has a different grouping for BDE which includes C in the grouping. Despite all the diagrams describing the same tree structure, a depicts a different structure to the rest which is why it is the outlier.
