#biol111 
A way of showing relationships between [[taxa]], usually [[species]]. They used to be made by morphology, physically observable characteristics. Nowadays made using [[dna]]. made based upon a [[hypothesis]], mapped based upon unknowables since we don't know the past of all [[organism|organisms]]. because of this some are better supported through evidence then others. The splits in the branches are aligned with a timeline at the bottom which describes the amount of time ago the split happened and the new groups were introduced. To find the common ancestor go back to the common node. 

You *cannot* see extinctions on a phylogeny diagram, therefor its impossible to compare diversification rates.

A branching tree depicting evolutionary (acestor-descendent) relationships among a group of organisms with a common ancestor.
