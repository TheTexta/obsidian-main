Natural Selection::Survival of the fittest cuh. [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Wallace]]. All organisms have potential for exponential growth - yet most populations remain relatively stable in the number of individuals which implies high mortality in nature. Traits vary among individuals, traits influence survival and traits are heritable. 

Conditions for natural selection::variation in traits, traits are heritable and differential survival/reproduction


Evolution via natural selection::
- Leads to ‘transmutation of species’ one into another over long time periods ([[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[Alfred Wallace|Wallace]])
- Acts in real time in observable time periods (Grants & many others)
- Organisms evolve in response to 
	- their environment
	- other organisms
