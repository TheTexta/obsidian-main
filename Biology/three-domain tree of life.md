The [[prokaryote|prokaryotes]] are not [[monophyly|monophyletic]] so they are not included on the tree. When a group has a name *in game* but don't share a real common ancestor they are called [[paraphyletic]]. When a group has two independent origins it is [[polyphyletic]]

##### Example
Reptiles are [[paraphyletic]] because they do not include the birds group (aves) so in a sense there classification isn't real.
