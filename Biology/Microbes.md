### Background
##### Why care about microbes
1. they make us sick
2. they make us not sick
	1. bacteria in the gut microbiome help train our immune system and protect against pathogens
3. They have been evolving for billions of years
	1. they have filled effectively every available niche on earth
	2. they are essential for *all* global nutrient cycles (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus) - the foundation of these cycles
4. They are continuing to evolve
	1. See point 1
	2. they are great models for evolution

##### The invisible world and its consequences

Koch's postulates showed how an isolated microorganism causing disease would introduce disease if introduced to a clean body. Showing a causal relationship between a microbe and a disease. 

##### Social lives of [[bacteria]]: [[symbiosis]] (living together)
- *vibrio fischeri* bacteria colonize the bobtailed squid and provide a useful "camouflage" function - an example of a [[symbiosis]] relationship
- there is a fine line between mutually beneficially relationship and [[pathogen|pathogenesis]] (e.g. *vibrio cholerae* which is [[pathogen|pathogenic]])
- [[symbiosis]] has played a major role in the evolution of life on earth
- most plants and animals have a microbiome: microbial communities living in and on them
- humans are ~2% bacteria by mass
	- These bacteria are mostly in the gut with about 100 common species
	- About 1:1 balance between bacterial and human cells in our body
	- About 100:1 by genes (a lot more variation genetically)

##### [[Bacteria]] have been evolving for billions of years
![[stromatolites examples.png]]
- [[Stromatolites]] fossils exist today dating back to 3500 million years old
- [[Stromatolites]] are living today
- Stromatolites are made of mats of [[filamentous]] [[cyanobacteria]]
##### The rise of [[cyanobacteria]]
![[banded iron formations from cyanobacteria.png]]
- [[cyanobacteria]] is responsible for creating banded iron formations of alternating layers of flint and iron oxide. the formed when the oxygen content of the atmosphere was high enough to oxidise ferrous to ferric iron. This was the consequence of the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis, at the latest 2500 Mya.
##### [[Bacteria]] as models of evolution
[[Richard Lenski]] transfered ecoli from one flask to the next every day, allowing the bacteria to grow since 1998. now we are at 85000 generations.
- around 25000 - mutators evolved
- for context there have been about 8000 generations of modern humans from Africa to today.
- The study shows the infinite adaptation has a fitness plateau (not a complete plateau)

##### [[Bacteria]] as models of very rapid evolution
- Evolution resistance against evolution-proof [[antimicrobial peptides]]
	- it has been claimed that cationic antimicrobial peptides exploit fundamental features of the bacterial cell so that resistance is much less likely to evolve than in the case of conventional antibiotics
	- In this selection experiment by Perron, Zasloff and Bell (2005) 22/24 lineages of *Escherichia coli* and *Pseudomonas fluorescens* independently evolved heritable mechanism of resistance to [[pexiganan]] when propagated in medium supplemented with this [[antimicrobial peptides|antimicrobial peptide]] for 600-700 generations.

### Definition
##### What is a microbe?
- Scale: half of the organisms less then 10um are microbes![[Screenshot 2024-09-22 at 10.35.13 PM.png]]
- Advantages of being small - microbes grow faster then bigger cells since small cells can absorb more nutrients per unit volume. (surface area grows non-linearly with volume)
##### Levels of biological organisation

| unit                             | mechanism                        | process                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Individual (e.g. a cell)         | metabolism and replication       | requires continual input of energy and material to keep the cell out of thermodynamic equilibrium           |
| population (of related cells)    | variation and evolution          | replication causes variation; reproduction causes competition. mean fitness increases                       |
| community (of different species) | consumption and nutrient cycling | populations are linked by consumption (food webs). Must be in mass and energy balance at level of ecosystem |
##### Cell Structure
On an abstract level: cells contain information that dictate their metabolism. more efficient metabolic systems have more rapid reproduction and growth. If the information system is coupled with the metabolic system by being enclosed in the same membrane. the information system that specifies a more efficient metabolic system will itself be replicated more rapidly. This process is called evolution by natural selection.
###### Explanation
- The boundary of a cell is the plasma membrane
	- It is a phospholipid bilayer![[Screenshot 2024-09-22 at 10.50.48 PM.png]]
	- The plasma membrane separates life inside from the environment outside
	- all traffic with the outside must take place across the membrane
- The dual system of the cell
	- The membrane of the cell encloses two distinct biochemical systems.
	- metabolism
		- The cell generates or harvests energy and channels it to synthesisze new biomass, including the components responsible for metabolism. essentially taking energy and building into itself. without a membrane the products of metabolism would rapidly diffuse away from one another.
	- information
		- the cell stores the information necessary to synthesise the metabolic system. without a membrane the information system could not be permanently linked to the metabolic system. 
- Growth leads to reproduction
	- Large cells are inefficient because volume increases faster than surface area. 
	- Once the cell has grown to a certain size it divides to form two daughter cells. 
	- both cells receive information and metabolic systems from their progenitor. 
	- Reproduction involves the division of biomass and the replication of information![[Screenshot 2024-09-22 at 10.57.16 PM.png]]
	- a more efficient metabolic system leads to more rapid growth and more rapid reproduction (evolution prioritises the system which is more efficient)
	- if the information system is coupled with the metabolic system by being enclosed in the same membrane the increased efficiency is heritable
	- the information system that specifies a more efficient metabolic system then itself be rpelicated more rapidly
	- this is called evolution by natural selection (in the context of microbes)
- The genome stores information
	- a typical bacterial genome comprises about 2 million base paris encoding about 2000 genes.
	- It is formed of a single molecule of DNA in a closed loop about 1.6mm long![[Screenshot 2024-09-22 at 11.00.48 PM.png]]
	- some cells have plasmids which are small DNA molecules that occur in bacteria but are not essential for normal function. ![[Screenshot 2024-09-22 at 11.01.39 PM.png]]
		- they replicate at the same time as chromosome but daughter cells dont always receive equal numbers
		- some plasmids encode conjugation that results in plasmid transfer from a donor to a recipient via a pilus![[Screenshot 2024-09-22 at 11.02.50 PM.png]]
		- plasmids encode functions beneficial but not essential to the host [[bacteria]]. but in some cases they are [[parasites]].
	- DNA Unzips like a zipper![[Screenshot 2024-09-22 at 11.04.42 PM.png]]
		- replication results in two copies of the [[chromosome]]
		- replication proceeds with occasional errors
			- The error rate of replication in bacteria is low about 10^-10 per base pair per replication. which leads to 10^-3 mutations per genome per replication. 
		- chromosome repelication and cell division are linked
	- diffirential reproduction leads to evolution by natural selection.
###### Central Dogma of molecular biology
DNA -> mRNA -> translation -> protein (machines which do the work of metabolism in the cell)

| Central Dogma | Function                                  | Units                         | Compartment                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| [[DNA]]       | information storage                       | Base Pairs                    | nucleus (eukaryotes) or cytoplasm (prokaryotes) |
| [[mRNA]]      | information retrieval ([[transcription]]) | Bases (single strand of ATGC) | cytoplasm                                       |
| (Translation) | product assembly (translation)            | Triplet code ([[codons]])     | [[ribosome]]                                    |
| [[protein]]   | Product                                   | 20+ different [[amino acids]] | [[cytoplasm]]                                   |
- [[Transcription]]
- [[Translation]]

##### The genetic code is redundant
There are 20 amino acids even though hypothetically 4^3 (64) could be encoded.
why only C, H, N, O and S used for amino acids (not K, P or Si)? - why 20? - why these 20?

Two theories
- A 'frozen accident' (Cricks theory) - something which happened early in evolution and worked so it got locked in and all subsequent life got produced from that
- Optimal biochemistry in view of versatility, cost of synthesis, etc. (redundancy is good for sequencing error since there can still be working code even with a mutation).
### The history of life on earth
##### Overview
- Most of the life which exists on earth has been purely microbial (4bya to 2bya)
- To our knowledge this only happened once (which is on earth)
- should def memorise the below

##### How did microbes evolve?
What is the difference between a stone and a sea-urchin?
The most important attributes of living organisms are
- genetic: self-replication and [[heritability]], because there alone confer ***evolvability***
- physiological: [[Metabolism]] and thus complexity.

**Three Theories** to explain the origin of life
- Special Creation (cannot be falsified therefor outside of science)
- [[Panspermia]]
- Spontaneous generation
##### [[Panspermia]]
##### [[Spontaneous Generation]]

##### [[The tree of life]]

##### Archaea
### [[Metabolism]]
