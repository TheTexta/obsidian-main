The idea that life on earth originated from elsewhere in the universe
- undirected panspermia - dispersal of microbes form planet to planet
- directed panspermia - deliberate seeding of planets by aliens
- misdirected panspermia - galactic pollution by spacecraft

##### Plausibility

observing the trendline - the origin of genomes if the trend holds is well before the origin of earths creation - panspermia is plausible?? The paper was not taken that seriously since the likelihood of a linear trend is unlikely. 
##### Undirected Panspermia
- Taken seriously because of the short interval between the appearance of permanent oceans and the first signs of life.
- Bacteria could by transported by meteors
	- evidence is examples of super old bacteria from permafrost, amber and salt.
- Objections
	- low local star density
	- low probabilty of capture - probably possible to get a lot from mars but since its the same age as earth its not useful
##### Direction Panspermia
- Advantage that it incorporates an effective/intentional dispesal mechanism
- Objections
	- It has taken 4By for intelligent life to evolve on Earth, and we still can't travel to other stars. assuming it too 4By elsewhere then we're getting very close to the age of the older stars. only very few planets could have been seeded.
	- no convincing evidence for intelligent life anywhere else produced
	- why did we only get bacteria?
##### Misdirection Panspermia
- NASA Viking Landers are sterilized to exacting microbiological standards - max of 300k spores per spacecraft with 300 spores per $m^2$
- Probably already happened - main attraction for this [[hypothesis]]
