We retain information better when our [[encoding]] is distributed over time due to the [[spacing effect]]. 

While [[massed practice]] can create fast short term learning and a feeling of confidence, those who learn quickly also forget quickly. [[Distributed practice]] produces better long-term recall, however if you spend too much time on one thing it becomes ineffective to further study.
