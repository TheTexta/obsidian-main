[[Cognitive Load]]
[[Active recall]]
[[Spaced repetition]]

## Why are the traditional methods inefficient?
Highlighting and reading over and over again is not the most efficient way to learn. Neither is [[Spaced repetition]], frequent flashcards, that effective. Especially when learning large quantities of material. 

## Whats the difference between learning studying and memory?
Studying is the stuff you do to produce learning. Studying is a physical "real" process of revising material in order to "learn" it. Learning is the cognitive process occurring to retain knowledge or memory. Memory is what we actually remember (duh), but learning is the cognitive process which strengthens the memory. TLDR; **Studying** is the process to induce **learning** cognitively which strengthens and builds the **memory**. Hard studying doesn't mean that effective learning is taking place. What we want is to optimise the efficiency of the study technique so that the learning is as affective as possible with the amount of time we spend studying. 

## How does the brain encode memories?
Memory is the process of storing and retaining information to recall at a later time. [[Information Processing Theory]] describes the process by which one processes information into memories. It is important to note that our memories gradually deteriorate over time. [[Active recall]] and [[Spaced repetition]] reduce the effect of this deterioration. The process of how you encode the information affects how it is remembered and "retrieved" after a given time. The reason [[Cognitive Load]] is effective is that all other techniques require the encoding of the information to be sound. 

## Definitions
Encoding. The process of receiving, processing and combining that information
Storage. The creation of a permanent record of the encoded information
Retrieval. The process of calling back the information

## Why are flashcards bad?
Flashcards and [[Spaced repetition]] techniques which utilise those aren't as effective as other [[Spaced repetition]] practice techniques. They don't promote synthesis, reorganisation,  comparison between existing ideas, or application therefor limiting there germane cognitive load potential. 

# Most effective Learning Techniques:
Things which are harder short term generally result in better long term storage of those ideas. 
## Spaced Practice
Spacing out your study sessions is the process of spaced practice.
## Interleaved Practice
Mixing up the problem types which you work on
## Contextual Variation
Seeing ideas in different situations and forcing yourself to apply them. Varying the situations in which the ideas are explored.
## Testing
Testing is testing.

## Whats the common denominator between these ideas?
These ideas all require retrieval in different contexts then what was originally learnt. This requires new links to be made between the brain as it is forced to organise this new information. These techniques are known as *retrieval practice* (testing and evaluation) not to be confused with *repetitive retrieval* (flash cards).

## What is the best technique then?
The best way to study something is to study it at a higher order level as soon as possible.

Practicing the skill you want to learn overall with the new knowledge is the best way to learn it as it gives you practical experience applying and utilising all the various other higher order techniques to learn something. Practiced recall can take the form of tests or free recall tests. This way you can practice encoding and retrieval at the same time. 


# Optimising Cognitive Load
### The goals are to:
* Simplify the incoming information
* Reduce the irrelevant information
* Maximise how new content is linked to old

## Tips
* Its better to build understanding about a complex topic then it is to just memorise it with active recall as this reduces the intrinsic cognitive load. Its like learning words without practicing them in sentences. 
* Activate prior knowledge: Go over existing knowledge and information on the subject. Understand how what you're learning relates to what you know. Bringing long term memories back to short term
* Organise what your learning: Organise the notes, active recall questions, etc. 
* [[deep processing]]: Instead of memorising terms, practice their application and learn how they relate with other terms and concepts. Think more about the meaning of the information that you're learning in order to properly understand it in a wider context then word memorisation. Writing your own summaries, teaching others, and other processes of transforming what your learning allow for you to gain a deeper understanding for the core underlying concept. Utilise the [[Feynman technique]].
* Distributed Practice: To be effective in learning you need to space out the learning over a large time period. Take breaks, get exercise and good sleep are essential and help long term memory creation.
* Scaffolding: Start off using worked examples and easy problems when learning a topic and work from there. Watching or reading through worked examples when starting a new topic is good for getting an understanding of the process behind the solution. Reducing cognitive load when learning the steps individually as the [[schema]] is already put in place. Once a scaffold is in place, increasing complexity is essential for proper understanding and long term memorisation of a topic. 
* Its worth mentioning the modality effect which describes how the mind processes audio and visual information separately. The short term memory has separate holds for audio and visual data. Therefor by maximising both your more effective in your learning. You can also work between the two, preventing overloading.
* Review content before its introduction. This allows for decreased germane cognitive load during the lecture as you already have a general idea of the topic and can focus on the important information. 
* **Trying to remember stuff without reference to it is the best way to quickly memorise a topic.** This is known as the [[Free Recall]] technique and is a form of [[active learning]].

## Darren Chai - How to take notes
* Question how the content relates to what you already know.
* How am I going to be tested on the topic?
* What is the professor about to say? By asking this question your able to come up with the idea the teacher is attempting to convey *by yourself*, which increases the cognitive load and engagement with the content.
