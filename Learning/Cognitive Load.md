## Cognitive Load Definition
Cognitive load refers to the load placed on the short term "working" memory. If there is too much cognitive load in areas unrelated to learning (distractions) then learning is inefficient. However if there isn't enough cognitive load then the learning is also inefficient. TLDR the harder the topic the more cognitive load and the more learning that occurs as a biproduct. 
## Cognitive Load Theory
Cognitive load theory refers to the way we consider short term memory while learning complex ideas or solving problems. Short term memory can only store so much information, without closely repeated spikes of remembering that short term information we can never advance beyond the short term memory stage and that information will be deemed irrelevant and forgotten. Cognitive load theory suggests to learn more effectively we should keep this limit in mind and only load a few pieces of information at a time. If overloaded we will forget and be more likely to make incorrect connections.

## What does cognitive load feel like?
If we want to achieve efficient learning its important to recognise the sensations that it creates so that we can achieve consistent and optimal load. Cognitive load feels "confusing", in the sense that your really putting your brain power towards trying to figure it out. If your asking a lot of questions about the content thats a good thing as it means that the brain is really trying to connect the idea with others, strengthening the remembrance of the new idea in the first place. If you're feeling bored or drowsy then you're not experiencing cognitive load. 

# Types of cognitive load:
## Intrinsic Cognitive Load
Simple topics require little processing capacity in short term memory, complex topics require more. Basically you have to learn the basics before you can learn the harder topics which require more processing and preconceived pathways and ideas in the brain. The number of elements which must be simultaneously processed in our working memory determines the complexity of the task. Intrinsic cognitive load basically just refers to how interconnected the topic you are learning is. The more interconnected the more difficult it is to learn. So the objective of cognitive load is to minimise intrinsic cog load by breaking topics into there most simplest and bite sized topics. 

## Extraneous Cognitive Load
Information not relevant to the learning. Distractions are a form of extraneous cognitive load and reducing this allows for better learning as the overall short term load is decreased. Simple and clear communication is also key to reducing extraneous cognitive load. IF your having to receive information from too many sources it becomes less effective learning because too much processing is going on. This is known as the [[split attention effect]]. This is why its so important to know the prerequisites to a topic before attempting to learn it. Otherwise you easily become distracted by what you don't already know. 

## Germane Cognitive Load
The load which happens as your brain classifies new information into [[schema]] to hold and relate it with other ideas. Its how we process information into long term memory. learning techniques aim to maximise this category of cognitive load as it promotes long to memorisation of topics.
