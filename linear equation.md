It is often convenient to write the variables as x1, x2, ..., xn, particularly when more than two variables are involved (as opposed to just using x,y,z). An equation of the form

$$a_1x_1 +a_2x_2 +···+a_nx_n = b$$

is called a [[linear equation]]. All linear equations occur such the variables are always to the first [[power]].
