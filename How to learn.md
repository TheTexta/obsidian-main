## How does learning work?
Learning works through 

## Why are the traditional methods inefficient?
Highlighting and reading over and over again is not the most efficient way to learn. Neither is spaced repetition, frequent flashcards, that effective. Especially when learning large quantities of material. 

## Whats the difference between learning studying and memory?
Studying is the stuff you do to produce learning. Studying is a physical "real" process of revising material in order to "learn" it. Learning is the cognitive process occurring to retain knowledge or memory. Memory is what we actually remember (duh), but learning is the cognitive process which strengthens the memory. TLDR; **Studying** is the process to induce **learning** cognitively which strengthens and builds the **memory**.

## How does the brain encode memories?
Memory is the process of storing and retaining information to recall at a later time. [[Information Processing Theory]] describes the process by which one processes information into memories. It is important to note that our memories gradually deteriorate over time. [[Active recall]] and [[spaced repetition]] reduce the effect of this deterioration. The process of how you encode the information affects how it is remembered and "retrieved" after a given time. The reason [[Cognitive Load]] is effective is that all other techniques require the encoding of the information to be sound. 

## Definitions
Encoding. The process of receiving, processing and combining that information
Storage. The creation of a permanent record of the encoded information
Retrieval. The process of calling back the information

## Tips
* Its better to build understanding about a complex topic then it is to just memorise it with active recall as this reduces the intrinsic cognitive load. Its like learning words without practicing them in sentences.
