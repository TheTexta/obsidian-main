$$\begin{pmatrix}  
1 & 0 & 0& |*\\  
0 & 1 & 0&|*\\
0 & 0 & 1&|*\\
\end{pmatrix}$$

A [[matrix]] is said to be in [[Row Echelon Form]] when if:
1. All zero rows are at the bottom
2. The first nonzero entry from the left in every row is a one (known as a leading one)
3. Every leading one must be to the right of a leading one above it

If a [[matrix]] also satisfies the following it is said to be in [[reduced row echelon form]]
1. Every entry above and below a leading 1 is 0. The only entry in its column which is nonzero.
