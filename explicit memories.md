Explicit Memories information we memorise consciously, episodic memories. Also known as declaritive memory.

Either they are [[semantic]] or [[episodic]]

The network that processes and stores new explicit memories of facts and episodes includes your [[frontal lobes]] and your [[hippocampus]].

Hippocampus acts like a save button for explicit memories. damage to this area means that we cant form new memories.
