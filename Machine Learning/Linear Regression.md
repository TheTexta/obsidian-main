Linear regression is, at its core, a method for finding a line of best fit, to fit to a graph of given data points. Linear regression uses [[Gradient Descent]] to sequentially optimise the line to best fit the dataset.

### Univariable Linear regression
Is the process of fitting a straight line to a graph with a single x input and single y output.

### Multivariable Linear Regression
Is still the process of a fitting a straight line to a given dataset but instead the input dataset is comprised of more then one x input for each data point. This could be visualized through a 3d plot (if there are 2 x inputs):
