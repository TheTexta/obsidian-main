There are tons of different machine learning models used for various problems.

[[Logistic Regression]]
A simple model which gives an output between 0 and 1 of the probability of a input belonging to a label. Uses a [[sigmoid activation]] function for the final layer of the model to perform binary classification.

[[Linear Regression]]
A simple model which takes an input and gives it a numerical output. Basically fits a line to example variables and gives predictions based on that line. Simple [[linear regression]] involves one input [[features vs examples|feature]] while multiple [[Linear Regression|linear regressions]] involves more.
