ndarrays are the [[Arrays]] object used and created by the [[NumPy]] library for python. Similar to [[TensorFlow]] [[Tensors]] they are a version of a 2d array with greater computation speed and integrated features. 

## Construction
```python
array = np.ndarray(shape)
```
wherein *shape* is defined as bracketed input of the size (row, col, depth, etc) of the array
