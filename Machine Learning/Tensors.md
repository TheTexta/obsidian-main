[[Tensors]] are the name for the multi-dimensional [[Arrays]] object built into [[TensorFlow]] which is used for storing and manipulating training data. They are similar to [[ndarrays]], but you cannot update the contents of tensors. [[Tensors]] are made as an alternative proprietary datatype for [[TensorFlow]] because default 2d arrays in python are not optimized for matrix multiplication. Tensors utilize the full power of the GPU, similar to [[ndarrays]], through optimized mathematical operations which utilize linear algebra techniques for faster computations. These work because tensors are similar to vectors in linear algebra, and, as such can be manipulated in the same efficient ways when performing mathematical operations on them
