There are many different ways of storing and manipulating data within a computer system. The most common of which are NumPy ndarrays and [[TensorFlow]] [[Tensors]], two commonly used data types for storing [[Arrays]] of data in python for data interpretation. Typically these propietrary array types are optimised for large computations due to there [[Vector]] like layout. Which allows for faster [[Gradient Descent]] when performed.
