Combinations are [[permutations]] which are scaled back for number of "same" arrangements where a same arrangement is one with the same contents but different arrangements. While permutations counts unique possibilities, it still can have repeating combinations or uniquely arranged but constant items. Combinations allows us to account for these constant items in unique arrangements, by forgetting about the arrangement entirely, so that we can focus purely on the combinations themselves and not the combinations possible *within* the combinations. We can find combinations with the [[nCr Formula]].
