What does it mean to belong to $\mathbb{R}^n$?

A vector belongs to $\mathbb{R}^n$ if it has n components, where each component is a real number. for example, a vector $\vec{v}=\pmatrix{x\\y\\z}$, a $3 \times 1$ [[column vector]], belongs to $\mathbb{R}^3$ because it has three real components. when we say $\vec{v}\in\mathbb{R}^n$ we are stating that vector $\vec{v}$ has $n$ components.
