a way of visualising a [[system of linear equations]] in [[Matrix]] form with coefficients and constants combined. augmented matrixes need to be [[Solving Augmented Matrixes|solved]]

eg. the [[Linear Equation|linear equations]]
$2x+4y=8$
$-x+y=3$
in [[Augmented Matrix]] form is
$$\begin{pmatrix}  
2 & 4 & |8\\  
-1 & 1 & |3  
\end{pmatrix}$$
where the left hand side is a coefficient [[Matrix]] combined with a right hand side constant [[Matrix]].
