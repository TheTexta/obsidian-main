let $p_0$ be a [[point]] and $\vec{d}$ a [[vector]].
The line that passes through $p_0$ in the direction $\vec{d}$ is is all points p such that $\vec{p_0}+t\vec{d}$

also written as a function of $t$, $l(t)=\vec{p_0} + t\vec{d}$

or parametric form as for ex
x=x_0+t_a
y=y_0+t_b
z=z_0+t_c
(p_0=0)

Ex. find equ of a line through two points, $p=(1,1,2)$ and $q=(3,0,4)$
Direction $\vec{d}=\vec{q}-\vec{p}=\pmatrix{2\\-1\\2}$
use p so
$l(t)=\vec{p}+t\vec{d}$
$l(t)=\pmatrix{1\\1\\2}+t\pmatrix{2\\-1\\2}$
### notes
1. sol to a system with one free variable - $\vec{x} = \vec{v} + t\vec{u}$ is a line.
2. p, d are not unique
