for any [[matrix]] the number of leading ones in the [[reduced row echelon form|RREF]] is the rank. The rank cannot be greater then the number of rows/columns. keep in mind these questions can look easier then they actuall are like question 1 in the example

For matrix A if it has 4 leading ones then the rank(A)=4.

[[free variables]] $=$ variables $-$ [[Matrix rank|rank]]
