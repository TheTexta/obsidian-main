Consider linear system with n variables, m equations. suppose we find RREF of augmented matrix, it has rank r. 
1. if the last column contains a leading one system is inconsistent.
2. assume system is consistent
	- if $r=n$, no free variables and hence only one solution.
	- If r<n, there are n-r free variables hence infinitely many solutions
