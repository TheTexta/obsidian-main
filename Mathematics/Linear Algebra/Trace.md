The trace of A n\times n matrix is the sum of entrees on diagonal.


##### Prop
A, B any n\times n matrices.
1. $tr(AB)=tr(BA)$
2. If $A, B$ similar then
	$tr(A)=tr(B)$

Comments
- If $A$,$B$ have different det or char poly, or eigenvalues, or trace A not similar to B. 
- How to prove there does not exist $C$ such that $A=CBC^{-1}$
