A [[linear systems]] with no [[Solution to a System|solution]] is called inconsistent. An inconsistent system of linear equations can be identified when the [[Augmented Matrix]] operated on (through [[Elementary Row Operation]]) or not produces a all zero line with a nonzero constant. To answer questions with variables where the variable has to be a number for an inconsisent, try and isolate the line with the variable so you can find the value for that variable to be equal to zero for the system to be inconsistent. 

#### Example
$$\begin{pmatrix}  
1 & -1 & 1& |*\\  
0 & 1 & 0&|*\\
0 & 0 & 0&|5\\
\end{pmatrix}$$
where the last row translates to $0x+0y+0z=5$ which is a [[contradiction]] therefor the system is [[Inconsistent]]
