- Multiplying vectors and matrices
	- You actually *cannot* multiply a vectors by another (of same dimension) but you can take the [[dot product]]. 
		- this is why vector transformations are defined by matrices.
	- You *can* multiply a $n$ [[row vector]] by an *n* [[column vector]] for a [[scalar]] singular number solution (1x1 [[matrix]]) however.
- Matrix matrix multiplication
	- For matrix multiplication the number of columns in A must equal the number of rows in B
	- The results dimension will always be A # of rows x B # of columns (different to the dimensionality requirements)
	- The element in $(i,j)$ is the dot product of ith row of matrix A by jth column of matrix B
	- **order matters** AB is different to BA
