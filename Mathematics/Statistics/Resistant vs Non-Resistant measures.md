What is resistance and non resistance in statistics::Measurements in statistics are considered resistant when not impacted by [[skew|skewiness]] / [[Outliers]]. non-resistant is the opposite. 

Non-resistant::Summary statistics which are non-resistant change or are impacted when [[Outliers]] are removed in a data set. Typically [[Mean]], [[Range]] and [[Standard Deviation]] are non-resistant
Resistant::Summary statistics which are resistant *do not change* or are *not impacted* when [[Outliers]] are removed in a data set. Typically [[Median]] and [[Inter Quartile Range|IQR]] are resistant, median being slightly more resistant then IQR
