A derivative is the equation for the slope of a graph at a given point on the graph. The function for the rate of change of a function at a given time

## Standard Definition
A derivative is defined by the following standard formula which is the [[Limits|limit]] of the function as the difference between two points in the function become $\infty$ small. :
$$ \lim_{h\to0}(\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}) $$
## Formulas for Derivatives:
### Product Rule
when two functions are multiplied together

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(a(x)\cdot{}b(x))=\frac{da}{dx}\cdot{b}+\frac{db}{dx}\cdot{a}
$$
### Chain Rule
when a functions result is the input of another
$$
\frac{d}{dx}(a(b(x)))=\frac{da}{dx}(b(x))\cdot{}\frac{db}{dx}(x)
$$
