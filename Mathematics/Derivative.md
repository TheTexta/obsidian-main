A derivative is the equation for the slope of a graph at a given point on the graph.

## Standard Definition
A derivative is defined by the following standard formula:
$$ \lim_{h\to0}(\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}) $$
## Formulas for Derivatives:
There are a variety of formulas for finding the derivatives of functions. The following are defined where
