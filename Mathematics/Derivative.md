A derivative is the equation for the slope of a graph at a given point on the graph. The function for the rate of change of a function at a given time. 

## Standard Definition
A derivative is defined by the following standard formula which is the [[Limits|limit]] of the function as the difference between two points in the function become $\infty$ small:
$$ \lim_{h\to0}(\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}) $$
## Definition of a slope derivative using limits at point a
$$
 \lim_{a\to0}(\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}) 
$$
## Implicit Differentiation

When you derive an equation with x *and y* at the same time. Just remember when you differentiate y in terms of x you derive it then multiply it by $\frac{dy}{dx}$. once you finish w all that you can rearrange the equation to find the rate of change as you change both x and y.

## Second derivatives
When you derivative the derivative. It's really not that hard just a lotta work.
## Formulas for Derivatives:

## THE THREE SISTERS BROTHA - differentiation rules
### Product Rule
when two functions are multiplied together

$$
\frac{d}{dx}(a(x)\cdot{}b(x))=\frac{da}{dx}\cdot{b}+\frac{db}{dx}\cdot{a}
$$
### Chain Rule
when a functions result is the input of another
$$
\frac{d}{dx}(a(b(x)))=\frac{da}{dx}(b(x))\cdot{}\frac{db}{dx}(x)
$$
### Quotient Rule
When a function is divided by another
$$
\frac{d}{dx}(\frac{u}{v}) = \frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2}
$$
## Derizzatives - That boy look bizzy . . nevermind he gettin rizzy

* $(u^x)' = xu^{x-1}\cdot u'$
* $(sin(x))' = cos(x)$
* $(cos(x))' = -sin(x)$
* $(tan(x))' = \frac{1}{cos^2(x)}$
* $(cot(x))'=-\frac{1}{sin^2(x)}$
* $(e^u)'=e^u \cdot u'$
* $(log_a(x))' = \frac{1}{xln(a)}$
* $(a^u)' = a^u \cdot ln(a) \cdot u'$
