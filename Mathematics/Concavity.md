Concavity is the rate of change of a functions [[derivative]]. If a function is *concave up*, the derivative is increasing in slope **or** the second [[derivative]] is positive, if it is *concave down* it is decreasing in slope **or** the second [[derivative]] is negative. To find [[Concavity]] we find points of interest and graph them.
