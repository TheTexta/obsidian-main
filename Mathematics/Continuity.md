If a function is continuous over a given interval then it can be drawn without lifting your pencil. A function is continuous at a given point if:
1. f(c) exists, where c is the domain
2. $\lim_{x\to c} f(c)$ exists
3. $\lim_{x\to c}f(x) = f(c)$ - *key point* if this is true then the function is continuous.

## Ways to represent intervals and continuity
() - round brackets indicate continuity but not including the number
$[\text{  }]$ - square brackets indicates continuity including the number
if a function is continuous on the right side but not the left then it is ( continuous as opposed to $\text{[}$ continuous
## Continuous Functions
* [[Polynomials|Polynomial Functions]]
* [[Rationals|Rational Functions]] - *sometimes*
* Absolute Functions
* Trigonometric Functions
* Exponential Functions
* Logarithmic Functions

## Types of Discontinuity
* Jump Discontinuity: Where left hand and right hand limits exist but do not point to the same number
* Removeable Discontinuity: Where the limit doesn't equal the original function
* Infinite Discontinuity: Where a limit approaches infinity, like a vertical asymptote.

## Theorems on Continuous Functions
* [[Extreme value theorem]]
* [[Intermediate Value Theorem]]
