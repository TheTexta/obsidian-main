If a function is continuous over a given interval then it can be drawn without lifting your pencil. A function is continuous at a given point if:
1. f(c) exists, where c is the domain
2. $\lim_{x\to c} f(c)$ exists
3. $\lim_{x\to c}f(x) = f(c)$

## Continuous Functions
* Polynomial Functions
* Rational Functions
* Absolute Functions
* Trigonometric Functions
* Exponential Functions
* Logarithmic Functions

## Types of Discontinuity
* Jump Discontinuity: Where left hand and right hand limits exist but do not point to the same number
* Removeable Discontinuity: Where the limit doesn't equal the original function
* Infinite Discontinuity: Where a limit approaches infinity, like a vertical asymptote.

## Theorems on Continuous Functions
* Extreme value theorem: If f is continuous over a,b then a max and min value exist within those intervals.
