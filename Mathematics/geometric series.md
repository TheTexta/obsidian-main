Series defined where terms are multiplied by a constant factor

$S= c\cdot \frac{1}{3} + c\cdot \frac{1}{3^2} + c\cdot \frac{1}{3^3} + (...)$

Sum of a geometric series is found through this formula
$\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a(r^k) = \frac{a}{1-r}$ where $|r|<1$ for convergence. If $|r|>=1$ then the series doesn't converge.
