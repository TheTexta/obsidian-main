If a function $f(x)$ is continuous over $[a,b]$ then every function value between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ must exist *at least once*. remember if not continuous the value could exist $0-\infty$ times

# Proofs
You may be asked to prove a value exists over a range using the intermediate value theorem. 
1. Prove the function has [[Continuity]] over the interval by stating its [[domain]].
2. Evaluate the two values in the interval
3. show that the the value that should exist if cont. exists in between the two points evaluated.
