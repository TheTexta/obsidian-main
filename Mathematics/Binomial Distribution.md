### Binomial Probability
$P(x) = _nC_r \cdot p^r \cdot q^{n-r}$

$E(x) = n \cdot p$

$n$ represents the number of trials
$x$ represents number of outcomes of a specific type within n trials
$_nC_r$ represents the number of combinations
$p$ represents the probability of success on a single trial
$q$ represents the probability of failure on a single trial


binomial distribution is basically just the probability of an event occuring *at least* x times in a given amount and looking at that as a whole.
