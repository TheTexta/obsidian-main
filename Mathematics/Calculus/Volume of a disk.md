Use [[Integration]] to to find the area of a disk. Basically take a function of the form $V=...$ and [[Integration|integrate]] it along the specified length.

Example:
$f(x)=x^2$
find the volume of the area under the function of $f(x)$ when rotated around the x axis from 0 to 4
$\pi \cdot \int_0^4{(x^2)^2}dx=\pi \cdot \frac{1}{5} (4)^5$
