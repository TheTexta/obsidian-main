A limit is the value of a function as it approaches a certain point.

## Basic Definition
$L = \lim_{x \to c} f(x)$
Where L is the value f(x) approaches as the x value gets closer to c.

### Left Hand v Right Hand
Limits have a left and right hand side, which describes the value the function approaches when the x value gets closer on the left hand side vs the right.

#### Left
$L = \lim_{x\to c^-}f(x)$
#### Right
$L = \lim_{x\to c^+}f(x)$

## Real Limits
For a limit to exist the LHS and RHS of the limit must exist and tend towards the same number. A limit can exist without the point of the limit being explicitly defined so long as the above rules are satisfied. A limits existence can be proved by calculating the RHS and LHS and confirming that they match/exist.

## Infinite Limits
A function is said to become infinite (positively/negatively) if the value of $x\to c$ is made arbitrarily large. eg. $\lim_{x\to c}f(x)=\pm\infty$. This is because for a limit to exist it must be a real finite number. If a limit is $\infty$ no matter what it does not exist.
