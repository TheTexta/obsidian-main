When doing or probabilities be sure to subtract all features present in the initial prodb with the dependent. 

### Example
The prob of getting attacked by a bear on your way home is 0.01 and the probability of getting rolled is 0.5. What is the probability that either happens?

Notice that the above questions has two events which are [[Non Mutually Exclusive Events]], meaning that they both can happen at the same time. This means to find the probability of both we add the two and subtrac the overlap. 

$P(\text{bear})+P(\text{rolled}) - P(P(B)*P(R))$

$0.01+0.5-(0.5*0.01)$
