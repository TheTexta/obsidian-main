Probability is the use of mathematics to predict likelihood of events. The probability of all events must add to one. We can use [[tree diagram]]s and [[venn diagram]]s to visualise and solve probabilities. 

## Event types
When we have an event, its complementary event are [[mutual exclusivity]]. There is also [[dependent events]] and [[independent events]].
### Event
Any outcome which can happen
### [[Complementary Event]]
Any outcome which can happen but not when the event happens. 
## Types of Probability
* [[Subjective Probability]]
	* Probability based on opinions/theory
* [[Theoretical Probability]]
	* Probability based on maths
* [[Experimental Probability]]
	* Probability based on results

## Formulas for Probability
### NPR
The number of ways r different things can be arranged with n different options (each option removed after selection).

There's a button for it on the calc but here's the formula anyway:
$$
^nPr = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}
$$



## Odds vs Fractions Probability
$\frac{5}{9}$ is the same as $5:4$ [[Odds]]
