If $f$ is continuous over $[a,x]$ and where $F(x)=\int{f(x)dx}$
### First
$f(x)=\frac{d}{dx}(\int_{a}^{x}f(t)dt)$
Basically a theorem for finding the [[derivative]] of the [[Integration|integral]] of a [[functions|function]].

### Second
$\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx = F(b)-F(a)$
Basically the area of a function is defined as the upper integral minus the lower integral
