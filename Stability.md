Stability::orbitals where the subshells are all all half full are relatively stable compared to previous arrangements, where some orbitals are empty. Most stable when subshell is completely full. **Empty > Full > Half Full > Partially Full** in stability. *Except for S orbitals which are always considered stable due to there small size*
