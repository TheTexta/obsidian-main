Systems are methods for breaking complex questions with many interlinking parts to simplified problems. A system is therefor, *a collection of objects*. An **object** is something you treat as though it has no internal structure. 

Typically, we ignore many parts of physics problems to make them easier to solve. e.g. when you drop a ball you don't typically need to take into account the internal forces of an object. Remember when using [[Force|newtons equations]], just because the whole systems acceleration and net force is x, does not mean the internal structures of that system have the same forces, they will instead have a fraction of that net force which we can find if we know the net force and the masses of the smaller parts.
