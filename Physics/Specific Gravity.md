#physics 
Specific gravity is the density of an object divided by the density of water. The units cancel and specific gravity is unitless as it is a ratio. Specific gravity allows us to determine the fraction of an object which will be submerged when floating in a tank. eg if a have a specific gravity of a 0.2, 20% of the object will be submerged when dropped in water. If the S.G. of an object is greater then 1 then the object will sink. 

### Formula
$$
\text{specifc gravity} = \frac{p_{object}}{p_{water}}
$$
