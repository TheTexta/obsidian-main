### Newtons Laws
### Contact Forces - Forces which require the objects to be touching
* [[Tension]] - A pulling force exerted by a string, chain or similar
* [[Normal Force]] - The force solids exert on one another which keeps them from falling through one another.
* [[Friction]] - The force which two contacting objects exert on one another to prevent sliding

### Long range forces - forces which don't require contact
* [[Gravity]] - The force which a large mass exerts on everything when nearby
* [[Electric Force]] - The force which push/pulls charged particles together
* [[Magnet force]] - The force which push/pulls fields of magnets together/apart
