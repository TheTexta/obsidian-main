- Self harm is more common in the female population although they suicide less and its obvious why because of this movie
- Good look at how the 2000s changed the high school landscape and how consumerism lead to the commodification of aesthetics
- Meant to show how there is social disregard of teenage agnst when there are larger problems causing these extreme behaviours 
- Girls will do anything to fit in
- codependent female friendships can be pretty involved
- this film is meant to be depressing because it shows how girls in a modern society will do anything to fit in. 
- great example of [[non suicidal self injury]].
