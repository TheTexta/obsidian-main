### 1. Elasticity

#### a) Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)

- **Formula**: $\text{PED}$ = $\frac{\text{\% Change in Quantity Demanded}}{\text{\% Change in Price}}$
- **Explanation**: Measures how much the quantity demanded of a good responds to a change in its price; high values indicate sensitivity to price changes.

#### b) Price Elasticity of Supply (PES)

- **Formula**: $\text{PES}$ = $\frac{\text{\% Change in Quantity Supplied}}{\text{\% Change in Price}}$
- **Explanation**: Assesses the responsiveness of the quantity supplied to a price change; higher values suggest greater responsiveness.

#### c) Income Elasticity of Demand (YED)

- **Formula**: $\text{YED}$ = $\frac{\text{\% Change in Quantity Demanded}}{\text{\% Change in Income}}$
- **Explanation**: Indicates how the quantity demanded of a good changes in response to a change in consumers' income.

#### d) Cross Elasticity of Demand (XED)

- **Formula**: $\text{XED}$ = $\frac{\text{\% Change in Quantity Demanded of Good A}}{\text{\% Change in Price of Good B}}$
- **Explanation**: Measures the responsiveness of the demand for one good to a change in the price of another good.

### 2. Market Equilibrium

#### a) Demand

- **Formula**: $Qd=a−bPQd​=a−bP$ (where QdQd​ is quantity demanded, PP is price, and aa, bb are constants)
- **Explanation**: Represents the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity consumers are willing to buy.

#### b) Supply

- **Formula**: $Qs=c+dPQs​=c+dP$ (where QsQs​ is quantity supplied, PP is price, and cc, dd are constants)
- **Explanation**: Shows the relationship between the price of a good and the amount producers are willing to supply.

#### c) Double Shifts

- **Formula**: Not a single formula, but involves shifts in both supply and demand curves.
- **Explanation**: Examines the impact on equilibrium when both the supply and demand curves shift simultaneously.

### 3. Surplus

#### a) Consumer Surplus

- **Formula**: Consumer Surplus=Willingness to Pay−Price PaidConsumer Surplus=Willingness to Pay−Price Paid
- **Explanation**: The difference between what consumers are willing to pay for a good and what they actually pay.

#### b) Producer Surplus

- **Formula**: Producer Surplus=Price Received−Cost of ProductionProducer Surplus=Price Received−Cost of Production
- **Explanation**: The difference between the price a producer receives for a good and the minimum amount they would accept.

#### c) Community Surplus

- **Formula**: Community Surplus=Consumer Surplus+Producer SurplusCommunity Surplus=Consumer Surplus+Producer Surplus
- **Explanation**: The sum of consumer and producer surplus, representing the total benefit to society from the production and consumption of goods and services.

These concepts and formulas are central to understanding microeconomic analysis, especially in the context of price mechanisms and market behaviors.
