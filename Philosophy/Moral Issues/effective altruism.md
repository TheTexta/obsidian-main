### utilitarism
[[consequentialism]] with minimal side constraints.
- minimal side constraints (never clarified)
- what is illegal (the justice system is about side constraints)
- because side constraints are so minimal we can still call their calculative approach consequentialist

EA provides three reasons compatible with consequentialism and psychology
- growth
	- investing for your capacity to give (ie Sam Bankmun Freud)
- total donations
	- take a developmentalist approach (slowly increasing donations with increased comfortability)
- attractiveness to outsides
	- miserable representatives make the movement unattractive to others so you need to do actions which attract.

welfarism
- reject some consequences (forest and 10 lives vs 100 lives example)
- quality adjusted life years
	- 1 year w normal health = 1 QALY
	- adding 1 year of eyesight = (value of yr w sight - yr without it) QALY
	- imperfect metric


cost effective analysis
$$\frac{\text{expected welfare in QALYs}}{
\text{cost in dollars}
}$$
NGO creating the most QALYs per dollars are invested in and supported
Benchmark: save the equivalent of a life for $4000. 

impartiality
the increase in the welfare of someone is of equal importance to the increase in the welfare of someone else. most consequentialists do not hold this principle - think we should give priority to those worse off. distinguishes utilitarianism from all other consequentialist views.

Earning to give:
- choosing a lucrative job not doing good directly
- donating a big part of what one earns
