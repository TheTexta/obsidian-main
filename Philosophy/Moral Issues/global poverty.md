#### Why only global poverty?
- distance shouldn't be a morally significant factor
- impartiality principle
Therefore local poverty and global poverty could be addressed

EA only focuses on [[global poverty]] because of the law of diminishing returns
**[[Local poverty]]** is relative poverty
- less than 60% of median incomes

**[[global poverty]]** is absolute or extreme poverty
- less than $2.15 per day in USA purchasing power

hundreds of times more effective in helping those suffering from global poverty

absolute poverty is geographically localised
#### Three types of interventions and the TIN framework
1. Global Health
	- individual
	- nutrients, medications, health services, and protection from disease
1. Systemic changes
	- National, large group
1. Social change: Education

Tractability:
1. global health
	- simplest to monitor
	- costs are easy to track
	- results context independent
2. systemic changes
	- very complex to track
	- might even be overall bad when implemented, might be reversed
	- significant and impossible to predict costs
	- results are entirely context dependent
3. social change (education)
	- more complex to monitor than global poverty
	- costs are easy to track (sim to global poverty)
	- results are context dependent (cultural differences, geography, employment opportunities, and community-specific challenges) - takes a long time to observe results

Impact:
1. global health
	- maximising opportunities: transmissible diseases (malaria) and parasite infections
2. systemic changes
	- very large populations are affected
	- probably a large impact on their lives
3. social change (education)
	- many people lack basic education
	- income increase of around 10%
	- 10% is a big difference for extreme poverty (but is probably not comparable with saving lives)

Neglectedness:
1. global health
	- specific health issues faced in developing countries are underfunded
	- vaccine, medicine, preventive measures already exist
2. systemic changes
	- highly neglected in practice even if a large literature in the academic world
	- highly organised interventions are necessary, otherwise we can do nothing about it
3. social change
	- neglected due to a lack of resources in developing countries
	- we can address these issues by enhancing infrastructure
