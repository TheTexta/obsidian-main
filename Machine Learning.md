Machine learning is a type of data science where machines are taught algorithms implicitly rather then explicitly through traditional explicit code. The goal of machine learning is to give a machine enough data so that it can find an algorithm to predict future data without the work of a human to manually go through and test for algorithms which best fit the dataset.

A basic form of machine learning is linear regression.
