A graph of price to number of goods consumed. As the price of a good goes up the quantity consumed will go down, according to the [[Law of demand]]. 

## Shifts on the Curve
The entire demand curve shifts when external factors change which relate to demand. [[PASIFIC]] factors all influence shifts on the curve. Generally factors that aren't relating to the price will cause a shift on the curve, as opposed to a movement.
## Movements along the curve
Movements along the curve happen when the price of a good increases or decreases.
