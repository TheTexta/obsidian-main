### Equations
$E_{\text{photon}} = KE_{\text{electron}} + \text{Work Function}_\text{metal}$ 
$hv=\frac{1}{2}m_eu^2+\phi$ 
$hv=\frac{1}{2}m_eu^2+hv_0$ 

where $u$ is the [[velocity]] of the [[electron]]

### Explanation

Einstein said $v_0$ is the threshold [[frequency]] where the [[electromagnetic radiation]] must be greater then that [[frequency]] to eject [[Electron|electrons]] ($hv>\phi$, relating it back to plank's equation). Brightness / [[amplitude]] doesn't affect this. Excess [[frequency]] is converted into the [[kinetic energy]] of the [[electron]]. For every [[electron]] absorbing that energy, there is one [[photon]] of light - the [[energy]] of each [[photon]] is hv. The number of [[Electron|electrons]] ejected isn't dependent on the [[frequency]], you just have to be over the threshold then the number ejected was constant from there on - the [[kinetic energy]] of the [[electron]] ejected would only get greater.
