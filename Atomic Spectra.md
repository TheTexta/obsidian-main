Spectra is unique to and characteristic of each element. It is the [[light]]/[[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]] emitted by atoms of varying [[proton]] count ([[Element|elements]]). Atomic spectra wasnt understood with the Rutherford atomic model. Instead of trying to understand, people came up with equations to describe the emission. Two equation which were found to work are [[Balmer's equation]] and [[Rydberg's equation]]. 

#### Examples of Spectra
