#### Perfect Competition
- All products are equal (homogeneous)
- Firms are price takers (They can't change the price)
- Normal economic profits in the long run
- No barriers to entry / exit
- Allocatively and productively efficient
- Increases of demand in the long run do not affect the price of an item
- If the long run supply curve is upward the industry has increasing costs
- In the long run the market price *never* changes
- average total cost is minimised in the long run
- Allocatively efficient in the short run; both allocatively efficient and productively efficient in the long run

##### Some stuff about markets but specifically with perfect competition to remember.
- After which worker does the law of diminishing marginal returns set it? when total product begins to decrease (can still be positive).
- ATC and AVC always intersect MC at local minima.
- Total cost at profit maximising point = atc times mc.
- Profit maximisation in the long run is where atc and mc intersect.
- shutdown when costs are less then fixed costs. 
- There are four short runst curves avc, afc, atc, and mc.
- The law of deminishing marginal retrusn occurs because of fixed resources, like cpaital and land 
- total product increases at an increasing rate due to speicalisation.
- Defining economies of scale - Long run total costs fall due to firms abilities to use mass saving techniques its cheaper to produce more
- Diseconomies of scale - Long run average total costs increase as firm gets to big and difficult to manage.
- **Firms will shutdown if the price falls below the minimum avc**
- in the long run firms are productively effecient because output is produces at the lowest cost
- in the long run firms are allocatively effecient because price equals marginal cost.

### Imperfect competition
- mb>mc at eq
- price descrimination is the process of selling same products at varying prices to different sellers.
#### Monopoly
- Profit maximiser - by raising costs and producing less then socially optimal output
- super normal profits in long run
- High barrier to entry
- Price maker
- Single seller
- Price discrimination (charging different prices to different clients)
- Product differentiation (differing products to competition)
- Produce less and at a higher price compared to perfect competition
- Monopolists cannot maximize total revenue by producing where MR=MC. But they can optimise there profit
- Monopolys maximise profit when marginal revenue is zero
- Zero econ profit when demand equals atc
- Anaturalmonopolyiswhenitisbesttohaveonlyonefirminanindustryduetoeconomiesofscale
- Price descrimination leads to no dwl and consumer surplus 
#### Oligopolistic Competition
- Small number of firms
- High barrier to entry
- Pricing driven by the oligopoly (demand curve) as opposed to price takers like in perfect competition
- Can involve either homogeneous products (e.g., steel, oil) or differentiated products (e.g., automobiles, smartphones).
- Can earn supernormal profits in the long run
#### Monopolistic Competition
- many firms
- Similar but different products
- Less price control and market power compared to oligopolistic competition
- lower barriers to entry then oligopolistic competition
- Firms can earn supernormal profits in the short run. However, in the long run, the ease of entry erodes these profits, leading to only normal profits.
- Downwards sloping demand curve
- price makers
