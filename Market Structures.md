#### Perfect Competition
- All products are equal (homogeneous)
- Firms are price takers (They can't change the price)
- Normal economic profits in the long run
- No barriers to entry / exit
- Allocatively and productively efficient
- Increases of demand in the long run do not affect the price of an item
- If the long run supply curve is upward the industry has increasing costs
- In the long run the market price *never* changes
- average total cost is minimised in the long run
- Allocatively efficient in the short run; both allocatively efficient and productively efficient in the long run

### Imperfect competition
- mb>mc at eq
#### Monopoly
- Profit maximiser - by raising costs and producing less then socially optimal output
- super normal profits in long run
- High barrier to entry
- Price maker
- Single seller
- Price discrimination (charging different prices to different clients)
- Product differentiation (differing products to competition)
- Produce less and at a higher price compared to perfect competition
#### Oligopolistic Competition
- Small number of firms
- High barrier to entry
- Pricing driven by the oligopoly (demand curve) as opposed to price takers like in perfect competition
- Can involve either homogeneous products (e.g., steel, oil) or differentiated products (e.g., automobiles, smartphones).
- Can earn supernormal profits in the long run
#### Monopolistic Competition
- many firms
- Similar but different products
- Less price control and market power compared to oligopolistic competition
- lower barriers to entry then oligopolistic competition
- Firms can earn supernormal profits in the short run. However, in the long run, the ease of entry erodes these profits, leading to only normal profits.
