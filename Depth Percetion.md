Depth is processed by taking the difference

Monocular Cues:
* Relative size
* Interposition
* Linear perspective - train tracks converging tells us that 
* Aerial perspective
* Light and shadows - shadow gives images dimension and shape.
* Texture gradient
Binocular Cues
* Convergence
* Retinal Disparity
