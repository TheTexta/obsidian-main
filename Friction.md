Friction is the force that two objects sliding against one another exert on each other as a result of the peaks/valleys which exist on the surface of an object rubbing against and interlocking with the other object. The strength of frictional force is dictated by the friction coefficient, $\mu$, which is a measure of the average friction which exists between two colliding surfaces.

### Static Friction
The friction existing between two stationary objects as a result of the difference in the surfaces of the two. static friction is equal / opposite to the force pushing it until the [[forces]] applied becomes greater then the $\mu_{static} * F_n$. 
### Kinetic Friction
The friction existing between two objects sliding against one another, the $\mu_{kinetic} < \mu_{static}$.
### Rolling Friction
### Fluid Friction
