Equilibrium is the process of [[supply]] and [[demand]] shifting in relation to one another. Equilibrium is the state where [[supply]] and [[demand]] are equal to each other.

When [[supply]] and [[demand]] shift, isolated or double, a new point of equilibrium is reached. Although [[disequilibrium]] will be shortly present as the [[market]] adjusts.

### Isolated Shifts
An shift in the supply or demand by itself can cause one of four resulting diagrams.

### Double Shifts
