Chemicals which transfer signals.
- Synthesis
- Storage
- Release
- Binding
- Deactivation

How are they made?
The nerve cell makes the chemicals and stores them in [[synaptic vesicles]], little bubbles in the cells where the neurotransmitters are stored.

How are they released?
The [[action potential]], triggers calcium channels to open up and calcium will rush into the cell. Causing the [[synaptic vesicles|vesicles]] to join the [[presynaptic membrane]]. Once fused the [[neurotransmitters]] will release.

How are they received?
Once they are released, they are received by receptors, which are specially designed / shaped to only take in one type of [[neurotransmitters|neurotransmitter]]. Once received, a [[action potential]] is triggered.

How are they deactivated and recycled?
Neurotransmitters floating in the space between need to be deactivated. Either they float away or are broken down by enzymes or they are reuptaken. Reuptake means that the neurotransmitters are collected by a special cell, and taken back to the terminal.

If a neurotransmitter is released while a action potential is already happening, the signal is hypo-polarised, which stops the signal. Which is called [[inhibition]]. [[Excitation]] is the opposite, when the transmitters cause a signal to start.
