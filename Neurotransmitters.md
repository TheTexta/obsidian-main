Chemicals which transfer signals.
- Synthesis
- Storage
- Release
- Binding
- Deactivation

How are they made?
The nerve cell makes the chemicals and stores them in [[synaptic vesicles]], little bubbles in the cells where the neurotransmitters are stored.


How are they released?
The [[action potential]], triggers calcium channels to open up and calcium will rush into the cell. Causing the [[synaptic vesicles|vesicles]] to join the [[presynaptic membrane]]. Once fused the [[neurotransmitters]] will release.

How are they received?
Once they are released, they are received by receptors, which are specially designed / shaped to only take in one type of [[neurotransmitters|neurotransmitter]]. Once received, a [[action potential]] is triggered.

How are they deactivated and recycled?
Neurotransmitters floating in the space between need to be deactivated. Either they float away or are broken down by enzymes or they are re-uptaken. Re-uptake means that the neurotransmitters are collected by a special cell, and taken back to the terminal.

If a neurotransmitter is released while a action potential is already happening, the signal is hypo-polarised, which stops the signal. Which is called [[inhibition]]. [[Excitation]] is the opposite, when the transmitters cause a signal to start. 

Types of neurotransmitters
 - Acetylcholine (ACh)
	 - Movement, learning, memory
	 - Alzheimers, ACh-producing neurons deteriorate
 - Dopamine
	 - Movement, learning, attention, and emotion
	 - Parkisons linked to parkisons. 
	 - Oversupply is linked to schizophrenia
 - *Serotonin*
	 - Mood, Hunger, Sleep, and arousal
	 - Undersupply linked to depression, drugs which raise [[serotonin]] levels are used to treat depression eg lexapro, ssris.
 - Norepinephrine - same as addrenalin
	 - Alertness, and arousal
	 - undersupply can epress
 - GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)
	 - Major inhibitor neurotransmitter
	 - Undersupply linked to seizures, tremors and insomnia.
 - Glutamate
	 - A major excitatory neurotransmitter, involved in memory
	 - Oversupply can overstimulate the brain, producing migraines or seizures
 - Endorphins
	 - Neurotransmitters that influence the perception of pain or pleasure.

Neurotransmitters have mimics, other chemicals can do exactly what neurotransmitters do. Like drugs.
* [[Agonist]], a drug that increases the length of the neurotransmitter or acts as one.
* [[Antagonist]], a drug that blocks or decreases the function of a neurotransmitter
* [[Re-uptake inhibitor]], makes the re-uptake of serotonin slow/stop.

How agonists and antagonists work
Agonists and antagonists work based on shape, agonists have the same binding shape for a receptor. Antagonists have the same shape but close the receptor.
