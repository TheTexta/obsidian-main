Where you have an input with a single output label but the output label can be one of many possible labels (generally > 2). A multi class classification model uses a [[Softmax Activation]] function to predict the probabilities of each output label being attributed to the input. The outputs of a multi class classification model must all add to one. The number within the output [[vector]] which is highest is presumed to be the label as it has the highest probability of being so. The multi-class classification model also uses a unique [[Cost or loss functions|loss function]] known as the [[Cross entropy loss function]] to grade the model and perform [[Feedforward and Backpropagation|backpropagation]].
