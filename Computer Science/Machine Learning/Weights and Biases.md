Weights and biases are individual *parameters* of a model which dictate the strength and direction that the input is transformed into the output. 

## Weights
Weights are the values which multiply the inputs into there transformed output. In the standard straight line equation $y = mx + b$ the weight is the $m$ part of the equation.
## Biases
The biases is the offset of the model. It doesn't effect higher or lower inputs to any varying degrees. Instead it offsets the whole output by a given amount. In $y = mx + b$ it is the $b$ of that equation.
