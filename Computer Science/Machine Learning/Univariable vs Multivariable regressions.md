Univariable, meaning *single variable* regression is a form of regression where the training set contains only one set of x input data. In the house size price prediction model that would be the size of the house in square meters. 

Multivariable regressions are those that involve more then one data point for each x input into the graph. In the housing price to space model that would require the introduction of a 3rd variable such as number of rooms or another meaningful and significant data point which we would recognize as having a high likelihood of relating to the price by which the house sells for.

To summarise multivariable refers to models with more then one [[features vs examples|feature]], uni refers to a single training set [[features vs examples|feature]].
