A map is a set of pairs, ${(x,f(x))}$. Each x in the domain maps to exactly one f(x) in codomain. but it can happen that $f(x1)=f(x2)$ for different x1, x2, i.e. many-to-one. for example two dishes can map to the same price. ![[Screenshot 2024-12-05 at 10.30.58 PM.png]]
A key cannot map to 2 different values at once.
