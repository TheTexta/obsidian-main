- U|We are interested in knowing how much tine an algorithm needs to perform a given task. Based on the number of basic operations the algorithm has to complete. 
- The notion of input size depends on the problem and can vary
	- number of elements in the input
	- number of bits required to represent the input
- Asymptotic notation apply to functions
- used to described the run time of algorithms. Can be applied to functions that describe other characteristics of an algorithm or functions that have nothing to do with algorithms. 
- [[Big O]]
- [[Big Omega]]
- [[Big Theta]]
