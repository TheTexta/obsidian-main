Sum found through formula:
$$
S_n = \frac{n}{2}\cdot (2a + (n-1)d)
$$

where
$S_n$ is the sum of the sequence
$n$ is the number of terms in the sequence
$d$ is the common difference between the terms
$a$ is the first term (have to calc first sometimes)

can also be expressed as:
$$
S_n = n\cdot (\frac{a_1+a_n}{2})
$$
which translates to a series of the form:
$$
S_n = a + 2a + 3a + ... + na
$$
