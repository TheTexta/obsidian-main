- when using println() with objects it calls the method toString() on the object to display the results
- you can write a [[toString method]] method in any class
- mutable vs immutable
	- [[immutable types]]
		- harder to make errors
		- can save on debugging time
		- safer
		- inefficient
	- [[mutable types]]
		- more flexible to work with
		- easier to make errors
		- updatable data types should be mutable
- Taking an array input and storing its reference directly in a private field is bad. If assigning reference types to private variables you should initialise it with propper checks. Same idea applies to setter and getter methods - do not return reference types by themselves for private classes. create temp variables and return those temp variables to protect for this. 
	- shallow copy vs deep copy
		- shallow copy is only the first layer copied of a 2d array
		- deep copy is both layers of a 2d array
- [[final]] variables
- [[UML Diagrams]]
- can you change the method equals()?
- [[inheritance]]
- The [[Object class]] is the [[superclass]] of all classes - made by java.
