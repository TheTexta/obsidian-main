- all fields should be declared as [[private]]
- [[method|methods]] which give access to values of fields are "getters" (accessors)
- [[method|methods]] which allow modification of a field are called "setters" (mutators)
- getters and setters allow for input validation which makes them better then have [[public]] [[variable|variables]].
- careful when returning a [[reference type]] - ensure you are giving access to intended things
