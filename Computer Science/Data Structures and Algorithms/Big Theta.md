Given a function $g(n)$, we denote by $\Theta (g(n))$ the following set of functions
$\Theta(g(n))=\{f(n)$: there exist positive constants $c_1$, $c_2$, and $n_0$ such that $c_1g(n)\leq f(n) \leq c_2g(n)$ for all $n\geq n_0\}$

$f(n)=\Theta(g(n)) \iff f(n)=O(g(n)) \text{ and } f(n)=\Omega(g(n))$

A tight bound doesn't always exist.
