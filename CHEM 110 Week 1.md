### Electromagnetic radiation and Light
[[electromagnetic radiation]] and [[light]] are the same thing

as [[wavelength]] increases the [[frequency]] decreases. they have a negative [[Correlational Coefficient|correlational]] relationship of coefficient -1. by knowing any one of these values you can calc the other. 

properties of [[wave|waves]] and particles:
- [[wave|waves]] undergo [[refraction]] - which creates rainbows.
- particles do not.
- [[wave|waves]] bend around an object if the width of an opening is comparable to that of the [[wavelength]] through the process of [[diffraction]]
- particles do not bend around small openings.

[[electromagnetic radiation]] shows [[constructive interference|constructive]] or [[descructive interference|destructive]] interference in there [[diffraction]] patterns.

### Particle nature of light
[[Blackbody radiation]]
warmer light glows at a slightly different wavelength which is actually warmer temperature wise.

the maxima in the blackbody curves shifts to shorter wavelengths as the temperatuer increase - metals being heated to high temperatures as the intensities of all visible lengths become appreicable. All bodies emit a form of electromagnetic radiation just shifted higher or lower due to the wavelength. 

##### Relationship between [[temperature]] and highest [[amplitude]] [[wavelength]]
The maximum amplitude wavelength exhibited by a body decreases as the temperature increases![[Screenshot 2024-09-10 at 5.01.57 PM.png]]

this worked well but at shorter wavelengths the intensity should be infinite but was not. This was known as the ultraviolet catastrophe because the mismatch was at the ultraviolet region. 

Planck derived a expression to describe the phenomenon of blackbody radiation b theorising that energy only assumed certain values (quantised). relating [[energy]] to [[frequency]]. every wavelength is associated with a quanta and frequency.

$E=nhv$

where 
- $E$ is the [[energy]] of radiation
- $n$ is the quantisation factor ($n=1,2,...$)
- $h$ is [[planck's constant]] ($6.6206876\cdot 10^{-34}$ J/s)

#### [[Photoelectric Effect]]

Light and matter are much more similar then we thought.
