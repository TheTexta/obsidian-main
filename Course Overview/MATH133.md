Methods:
* [[Solving Augmented Matrixes]] through [[Elementary Operations]] and [[Elementary Row Operation|row operations]]
* Converting [[Linear Equation|linear equations]] to [[Augmented Matrix|augmented matrices]]
* [[Notating solutions to system problems with R]]
* When you substitute in questions you need to sub in all possible solutions since there can be multiple solutions to any matrix its not worth trying to simplify ![[Screenshot 2024-09-11 at 11.54.26 PM.png]]
