## Lab Instructions
- Read the lab manual.
- Complete the pre-lab quiz on myCourses, you must get at least 70% (5 trials are allowed)
- Rewrite the lab procedure in a point form in your own words (typed, handwritten and in a diagram/schematic form is accepted) and print it.
- Bring your personalized lab procedure with you. Your TA will check your procedure and sign it. (worth 2 points)
- **You must submit an electronic copy of your procedure for each experiment on MyCourses after the lab.**
- Answer the extra questions at the end of the lab manual. These will not be graded but will help you prepare for the lab and the final lab quiz.
- Print the datasheets provided in the manual and bring them to the lab, this is where you will record data and observations. You will only be able to see the datasheets once you receive ≥ 70% on the pre-lab quiz.
- All writing done in the lab must be in permanent ink (no pencil). Mistakes are to be corrected by drawing a single line through the error. Liquid paper and other techniques which make it impossible to read the original entry are not allowed.
- Before leaving, ask your TA to sign your data sheet. The data sheets that are not signed by a TA, will automatically receive “0” grade.
- You may also receive up to a 10%-point penalty on your lab report if we have to remind you to put your safety glasses during the lab more then once.
#### Attendance and Missing Labs
- Lab attendance is mandatory, and any missed labs must be made up for. You will be automatically given “0” for any lab you do not attend, and any lab report you do not submit.
- Attendance taken with ID card
- Cannot be more then 15 minutes late to labs
- Missed labs must be made up
- There are six (6) labs in total and two (2) labs constitute 33% of the lab load.
- If you miss a lab for an approved reason and you provide an excuse note, you will be able to make up your lab without penalty. Otherwise, the following penalties will be applied to your lab report(s): 25% deduction for the first occurrence, 50% for the second, and 100% for the third.
- If the first lab you miss is due to illness, you do not need to provide a medical note as long as you inform *Mr. Shaath* by email _before_ your scheduled lab; the 25% penalty will be waived in this case.
- Makeup labs must be arranged in advance. In case of a missed lab, contact the lab coordinator [Mr. Shaath](mailto:badawy.shaath@mcgill.ca?Subject=Chem%20110-120%20absense) as soon as possible. Please include your lab day/time, group, course number, and student number in your email.
#### Lab Reports
Lab report is an essential part of a laboratory experiment. Submitting a satisfactory lab report after attending the lab is mandatory.
**Failure to submit 2 or more reports will result in an automatic failure of the lab course component.**

**Experimental lab reports will comprise:**

| **Personalized Procedure –** to be written before coming to the lab                                       | 2 points |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| **Datasheet –** to be completed during the lab                                                            | 3 points |
| **Results Report –** to be completed either during or after the lab (will be specified in the lab manual) | 20 marks |


A Report template will be provided for each experiment under the experiment tab on _myCourses_ either as a printable HTML document or in .docx format depending on the experiment.

The Lab Reports, including a report (in *.pdf format), a TA signed datasheet (in .pdf or picture format) and a TA signed personalized procedure (in *.pdf or picture format), must be submitted electronically in the "Assignments" on _myCourses_ within 2 days from the end of your scheduled lab period. (For example, if your lab is from 2:30 – 5:00 p.m. on September 10, your lab report is due 2 days from the completion of your lab, on September 12 at 23:59 p.m.).

###### Submission
- It is your responsibility to double check the file you have submitted on _myCourses_ to ensure that it is in a condition that it can be graded. Please consult the file submission instructions [here](https://mycourses2.mcgill.ca/d2l/le/lessons/737189/topics/7856333).
- Any work that is submitted but is the wrong format, blank, the wrong file, corrupt or submitted in any other condition that renders it unreadable or un-gradable, will be initially assigned a grade of zero.

**_Work submitted for evaluation as part of this course may be checked with text-matching software within MyCourses._**

#### Lateness
- A penalty of 5% will be applied to anything (lab report, quizzes, datasheets, procedures) that is submitted late but within 48 hours of the posted deadline (at 23:59 pm on a second day after your lab).
- Anything submitted more than 48 hours late past the original deadline will be marked with a 20% penalty. All work and quizzes must be submitted within 7 days of the original posted deadline (at 23:59 pm), or it will receive a grade of 0.
- Late penalties are applied based on the _myCourses_ time stamp. There are no exceptions to this rule. (_i.e._ we will not consider created or modified dates in the metadata of the file; we will only consider the date _submitted_ to _myCourses_ when assessing late penalties).
