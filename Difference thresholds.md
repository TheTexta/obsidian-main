Difference Thresholds::The minimum difference between two stimuli required for detection 50% of the time. We experience the difference threshold as a just noticeable difference (***JND***). The detectable difference increases with the size of the stimulus. 


At what point can you hear the difference between two simulis, eg changing pitch of an audio track. Just noticeable difference is the point where you notice the difference, its a percentage of the thing kinda.
