1. Linear Equations and Geometry

ex. [[system of linear equations]]:
$2x-y=3$
$x+2y=y$

[[system of linear equations]] of 2 equations 2 variable two lines (eg a system of linear equations) could have:
- point of intersection - one solution
- the lines could be parallel - no solution
- the lines could be the same - meaning there an inf. many solutions

Lines and Planes:
Equations of the form, $ax + by=c$ are used in this course because you cant have vertical lines with the $y=mx+b$ form. [[Plane|Planes]] are all possible solutions for a equation in 3rd dimension or higher form. 


Notation:
Without context $x=2$ written by itself is unclear.

$\mathbb{R}$ = set of real numbers

$\mathbb{R}^2$ = $\{x,y | x,y e\mathbb{R}\}$
"|" refers to such as

$\mathbb{R}^n$ = $\{x_1,x_2 ... x_n | x_1,x_2 ... x_n e\mathbb{R}\}$
Dimensions above $n=3$ are impossible to visualise and it is unnecessary to do so.



In general a linear equation:
$a_1x_1 + a_n x_n =b$
where $x_n$ is a variable and $a_n$ is $e$$\mathbb{R}$.

bER repesents an (n-1) dimensional "flat" object in n-dimensional space. This is called a [[Hyperplane]].


Dot:
A system of linear equations in variables $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ is a set of linear equations. 
$a_{11} x_1 + a_{12} x_2 + ... + a_{1n} X_n = b1$
$a_{21} x_1 + a_{22} x_2 + ... + a_{2n} X_n = b2$
$...$
$a_{m1} x_1 + a_{m2} x_2 + ... + a_{mn} X_n = bm$
where each $a_{ij}$, $i$ = equation # and $j$ = variable #. j is a real number called the coefficients, each b_i ele of R is called the constants. the set of solutions is all points, c_1, c_21 ... C_n C is a ele of real ^ n. Geometrically it is an intersection of m hyperplanes in the Rn Space.

Planes which intersect have infinitely many solutions. 3 intersecting planes which are not parallel will intersect for 1 solution. 

Solving Systems:
$2x+4y=8$
$-x+y=3$

$y=\frac{7}{3}$
$x=-\frac{2}{3}$

You can solve by adding then replacing the original equation but substituting in a new derived equations to create a single variable equation so you can find the answer. 


Systems can be put into [[Augmented Matrix]]
