A plane is geometrically a flat 2 dimensional space extending infinitely in in a three dimensional space. It can be described with a linear equation of three variables ($x$,$y$,$z$). A plane is just a [[hyperplane]] in three dimensions specifically.

Represented in the form:
$$ax+by+cz=d$$
Where $a$,$b$ and $c$ are coefficients determining the orientation of the plane and $d$ is the constant term which determines the planes position relative to the origin. 

### Properties of a plane
- **Dimensionality**: A plane is a two-dimensional object, meaning that any point on the plane can be described using two parameters (e.g., $x$ and $y$, with $z$ determined by the equation).
- **Infinite Extent**: A plane extends infinitely in all directions within its two dimensions.
- **Intersection**: In three-dimensional space:
    - The intersection of two planes is generally a line.
    - The intersection of three planes can be a point (if they intersect at a single point), a line (if two are parallel and the third intersects them), or another plane (if all three are parallel and coincide).
