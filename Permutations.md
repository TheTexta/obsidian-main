When we have a given number of items and limited positions, where any item can occupy x number of positions, and we want to find the number of unique combinations of those positions we use [[Factorial|factorials]]. If we have a number of positions *less* then the total number of uniques to fill them, then we use the [[nPr formula]]. It's important to remember that permutations *counts* possibilities with the same set of uniques in a different position, eg, ABC, BAC, BCA, and ACB are all a unique permutation. Permutations are *not* [[Probability|probabilities]], as permutations don't scale for the number of same options which occur multiple times in probabilities.
