focussed on community and culture/rituals. Focuses on the community as a whole rather then individuals. Everyone works and benefits from others works equally. 

## Examples
Small societies focused on resource gathering, farming and hunting are considered traditional economies. eg traditional Indigenous societies in Australia. 

## The three basic economical questions
What to produce  - value for the society as a whole
How to produce  - group effort and shared beliefs of community importance dictated by rituals and religion
For whom to produce  - The community produces for everyone within it as a whole. Everything is “shared” so to speak
