***Remember to study last module Unit 2***

[[absolute threshold]] vs [[Difference thresholds]]- absolute is when you can / cant detect, difference is when you can detect only 50% of times.

sensory adaptation vs habituation - Sensory adaptation is when your senses lessen in there perception of something, habituation is when you cognitively block a perception which is still as strong.

cones vs rods bipolar cell relationship - cones have direct connections to bipolar cells, rods share connections.

feature detectors - let you see angles, edges, movement

figure ground - allow for you to differentiate the background from the foreground of a dancer on a stage.

place theory vs pitch theory - Place theory is in place for higher frequencies and pitch theory is in place for lower frequencies (<100hz).

ear canal - eardrum - hammer - anvil - stirup - oval window - cochlea

***Gestalt***

[[signal detection theory]] - how we can detect stimulus amid background noise. thresholds are dependent on psychological state. Some signals are more important then others. 

[[otolith organs]]
Saccule - vertical movements
Utricle - Horizontal movements

[[bipolar cells]] go to [[ganglion cells]]

[[basilla membrane]] holds the [[organ of corti]]

Vestibular sense - sense of balance

[[olfactory bulbs]] receives impulses and transmits information to primary olfactory cortex
[[Nociceptor]] - Harmful pressure or harmful temperature, skin receptor cells

*Gate control theory* - pain goes through spinal cord and is controlled by gates which can be closed through massage.

[[Embedded Cognition]] - influence of body sensations on cognitive judgements

Eardrum - makes the sounds louder at the end of the ear canal

parallel processing - how we are able to recognise faces without effort and concentration.

[[Perceptual Set]] - a mental predisposition to perceive something one way or another. hearing lines in audio when told it is there.

[[Precognition]] - its bullshit, perceiving future events

Relative Luminance

Frequency theory - A theory which explains pitch as being related to how fast the basilar membrane vibrates, higher pitch = faster vibrations.

choice blindness

[[place theory]] - how pitch relates to the location of the cells receiving the impulse

[[sensory adaptation]] - unchanging information from a sensor is ignored

McGurk Effect

Gate-Control Theory

Perceptual Constancy - A [top-down process](app://obsidian.md/Top-down%20Processing) where objects are perceived as unchanging regardless of viewing angle.
